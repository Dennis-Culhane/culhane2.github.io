    "abstract": "In this book we present a new approach to promoting more effective, efficient, and ethical intergovernmental decision making and problem solvinga system we call actionable intelligence for social policy (AISP). Actionable Intelligence (AI) is neither data nor research, although it involves both. It is derived from the combined contributions from executive leaders, practitioners, researchers, and citizens. It requires intergovernmental coordination and collaboration among bureaucracies. It is what is needed to inform disciplined, evidence-based decision making. We developed the AISP model to address the major limitations to traditional approaches to American public administration identified in the literature.Actionable Intelligence is a robust integrated data system (IDS)IDS integrates individual citizens data across agencies to provide scientifically sound, intergovernmental information to inform AIAI can provide a comprehensive picture of the whole person and has the potential of bringing everyone from health, education, and humans service agencies together around one tableThrough the use of an IDS, data-sharing agencies can contribute their clients data to one collaborative process to achieve a more thorough understanding of a pressing social problem and what to do about it",

    "abstract": "This report examines health services use and population dynamics among the aging homeless population in Los Angeles. Evidence suggests that adverse health outcomes lead to homelessness, and the conditions related to homelessness lead to or exacerbate a range of health problems (Hwang, 2001). In addition, the barriers to accessing preventative and primary care while homeless lead to receipt of healthcare only when morbidities are more acute, (Reid, Vittinghoff, & Kushel, 2008; Kushel, Gupta, Gee, & Haas, 2006; Lim, Andersen, Leake, Cunningham, & Gelberg, 2002) meaning that there is a disproportionate use of inpatient hospitalization and other costly medical and behavioral health services among persons experiencing homelessness (Doran et al., 2013; Hwang, Weaver, Aubry, & Hoch, 2011; Kushel, Perry, Bangsberg, Clark, & Moss, 2002; Salit, Kuhm & Hartz, 1998). As a result, homelessness is expensive for healthcare systems and for society as a whole (Latimer et al., 2017; Flaming, Burns, & Matsunaga, 2009; Culhane, 2008). Given this, interest in using healthcare systems as a platform to address homelessness has grown in recent years. Strategies include efforts to identify homelesspatients in healthcare settings in order to link them with housing and social services (Garg, Toy, Tripodis,Silverstein, & Freeman, 2015; Gottlieb, Hessler, Long, Amaya, & Adler, 2014); the creation of accountable care organizations that seek to coordinate healthcare and social services for persons experiencing housing instability (Mahadevan & Houston, 2015); and the development of new financing mechanisms geared towards using healthcare dollars to support housing stability (Burt, Wilkins, & Locke, 2014).",

The chapter begins with a brief overview of homelessness among Veterans historically, with the remainder of the chapter focusing on the prevalence and incidence of homelessness among Veterans over the past decade. The methodological considerations discussed in this chapter include issues surrounding conceptual definitions of homelessness, implications related to the time frame used for estimates, a comparison between point prevalence, period prevalence, and incidence, and a description of various approaches for using primary and administrative data to estimate the magnitude and composition of homelessness among Veterans. Finally, we present recent national estimates of the prevalence and incidence of homelessness among Veterans, along with a summary of trends over time, and segmentation of estimates by demographic, geographic, and housing status characteristics.",

    "abstract": "While in the US a large volume of quantitative impact studies on homelessness has been generated over many years, homelessness researchers in the UK have tended to be concerned, at least until recently, with more qualitative and conceptual forms of exploration and evaluation. This contrast between the US and UK extant homelessness literatures can be traced back to the different research traditions that have emerged over the years on opposite sides of the Atlantic (Fitzpatrick and Christian, 2006). In the UK, applied housing studies specialists have tended to dominate academic research on homelessness, with the important role played by domestic legislation in tackling homelessness in the UK also meaning that there is a strong tradition of socio-legal scholarship in this field (Cowan, 2019). More theoretical contributions in the UK, as in the US, often emerge from urban geography or sociology perspectives (Lancione, 2013), although a sharply contrasting conceptual approach within the UK now sees mainstream moral philosophy applied to the ethical challenges and dilemmas that abound in homelessness policy and practice (Watts et al, 2017). Health-orientated research on homelessness has generally been relatively marginal to the policy debate in the UK, not least because it is often very narrowly focused (for example on oral health or blood-borne viruses among specific homeless subpopulations). That said, there is now increasing engagement from UK-based public health specialists in the complex needs of homeless people who face compounding problems of substance misuse, mental ill-health and/or involvement in the criminal justice system (Aldridge et al, 2018; Luchenski et al, 2018). In the US, by contrast, psychological, sociological and medical perspectives have long played a central role in homelessness research, along with significant contributions from social policy and economics scholars. The prominence of these clinical perspectives, and a more quantitative approach in the social sciences more generally, has engendered a research tradition heavily slanted toward statistical research and policy and programme evaluation. Here we explore the UK and US traditions with a view to identifying how new opportunities presented by developments in the field might help forge a path to better homelessness research and, more importantly, better homelessness responses.",

This leadership has proven to be critically influential as the European Commission moves forward with its antipoverty goals for 2020. This timely volume will help bring further momentum to this cause, by framing much of what has been learned, and many of the important questions yet to be addressed in this highly complex, multinational context.",

    "abstract": "An Increasingly Urgent Problem Collides with the Challenging Realities of a Pandemic. The implementation framework provided here builds on a March 24, 2020 report prepared by the CEOs Office of Homeless Initiative (HI), which provides the basic contours for an Older Adult Housing Pilot that would seek to permanently house all willing homeless adults who are at least 65 years of age. The HIs report, however, represents deliberations and the realities of Los Angeles Countys homeless services system prior to the onset of the coronavirus public health emergency. The implications of the pandemic have unfolded contemporaneously with the development of a pilot implementation approach and created some challenges for the pilot planning process during the past six months, particularly in terms of questions about pilot funding sources. While some details have gradually come into sharper focus over this period, a number of key issues remain unresolved at the present time, and the availability of some previously assumed funding sources has been deferred until Year Two of the pilot, at the earliest.Within this fluid context, the plan we offer in this report - the projected population for which is shown in Figure 1, along with the costs associated with serving these clients - represents a necessary modification of our initial plan but also reflects the persistence of a basic tension: While COVID-19 temporarily, but indefinitely, places restrictions on the use of previously-available resources, older adult homelessness is a growing and increasingly expensive problem, one likely to worsen in the absence of a systematic and coordinated intervention. More immediately, the heightened risk of complications and fatality for older adults who become infected with the coronavirus adds to the urgency of moving homeless older adults from the streets to the safety of permanent housing.",

    "abstract": "New York City, faced since the 1970s with growing numbers of homeless individuals and families, and aggressive litigation on their behalf, has built the largest public shelter system in the United States as the centerpiece of its response to homelessness. The size of this system -- both its average daily census of 24,472 in 1995, and its annual expenditures of $500 million -- is far beyond the scope of any other city's efforts against homelessness. Yet despite the scale of these measures the shelter system has faced crises and controversies through three mayoral administrations and their varied approaches to reducing the need for this system. This chapter assesses homelessness policy in New York City through analyzing empirical data collected from the shelter system. A variety of approaches produce a set of shelter utilizations and trends that, taken together, form a unique and grounded perspective from which to evaluate key components of this policy.",

They observe that research on the costs of homelessness and cost offsets associated with intervention programs has been limited to people who are homeless with severe mental illness. But this research has raised awareness of the value of this approach, such that dozens of new studies in this area are underway, mostly focused on \"chronic homelessness.\" Less progress has been made in using cost and performance data to systematically assess interventions for families, youth, and transitionally homeless adults. The authors present case studies of promising practices from the State of Arizona and Columbus, Ohio, demonstrating innovative uses of client and program data to measure performance and improve program management toward state policy goals, such as increased housing placement rates, reduced lengths of homelessness, and improved housing stability.",

    "abstract": "The homeless population is aging. While the aging of the post-War baby boom population in general might suggest that this is not at all surprising, the age structure of the adult homeless population is distinct. As shown in Figure 1, three decennial censuses have revealed a cohort effect among the adult homeless population (Easterlin, 1979). Most of the adult homeless population since 1990, and likely for several years before, is concentrated among the latter half of the post-War baby boom population, born between 1955 and 1965 (Culhane et al., 2013). This has persisted for thirty years, and the 2020 Census will undoubtedly reveal a continuation of that trend. In 2020, the average age in this cohort will be 60 in a population with a life expectancy of 64 (Metraux et al., 2011). This trend has important implications for homelessness assistance programs, which have not in recent history experienced elderly homelessness in significant numbers.",

This rapid expert consultation reviews research on disaster vulnerability, homelessness, the COVID-19 pandemic, and intersecting hazards and disasters. It includes (1) considerations for alternative shelter facilities for homeless populations during a disaster, (2) suggestions on how to navigate service reductions and support population-specific needs, and (3) guidance for supporting populations experiencing homelessness in the aftermath of disasters.The use of alternative shelter facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic presents new challenges for emergency planners; local decision makers; providers of homeless services; and individuals and organizations embedded in continuums of care that need to take steps to create and implement disaster preparedness, response, and recovery plans, for both their organizations and the people they serve. During the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions to key services for populations experiencing homelessness may lead to secondary effects in the context of a disaster, including effects on health and safety, which require additional population-specific support. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disaster vulnerability for many individuals and communities, and as a result, additional strategies are needed for addressing housing precarity and removing barriers to disaster assistance in the aftermath of a disaster.",
