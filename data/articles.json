    "abstract": "This report is the final deliverable of a study of the housing needs of persons with HIV/AIDS in the New York City Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area that was commissioned in 2001 by the New York City MayorÃ¢ÂÂs Office of AIDS Policy Coordination under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentÃ¢ÂÂs Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program. The Hudson Planning Group (HPG) and a team of professionals including the University of Pennsylvania Center for Mental Health Policy and Services Research, the Center for Urban Community Services, and Public Sector Research was selected to perform the assessment under the direction of the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health (PCMH), as the CityÃ¢ÂÂs Master Contractor, and with the help of an Advisory Group composed of consumers, service providers, government representatives and experts in health and housing policy. The release of the report has been delayed close to a year beyond its due date. The assessment was scheduled to take two years and to be completed in the fall of 2003, in accordance with the terms of an agreement between HPG and the PCMH. HPG submitted a complete draft of the report to the York City Department of Health and Mental HygieneÃ¢ÂÂs Bureau of HIV/AIDS in February 2004. Review and comment by City agencies and HPGÃ¢ÂÂs revisions to the draft took an extended time and the final report is being released in November 2004. Accordingly, data in the report are current as of December 2003, with the exception of a few cases where it is noted that more recent data were provided at the request of a City agency reviewing the report.",

    "abstract": "This evaluation is an independent examination of the City of Philadelphia’s Encampment Resolution Pilot (ERP), an initiative to shut down two homeless encampments located in the Kensington section of Philadelphia. The closure process involved an extended period of active outreach that facilitated access to housing, substance use treatment, and other services to people who stayed in the encampments and faced displacement. We examined two primary outcomes: first, whether the encampments were closed as scheduled and remained closed; and, second, the extent to which the people who were sleeping in the encampments (i.e., the target population) received needed services.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation is based upon five primary data collection activities that, combined, provided a timely, multifaceted assessment of ERP, and particularly of the impacts ERP had on both those displaced by the initiative and the area of Kensington surrounding these encampments. These data components are:\r\n\r\n1. An “Outreach Encampment and Survey” of 169 persons who frequented the encampments;\r\n2. Data collected as part of ERP outreach services and linked to the City of Philadelphia’s integrated data system of services records known as CARES;\r\n3. Direct observation of community meetings, ERP planning meetings, and encampment sites;\r\n4. Interviews with people who stayed in encampments and community members as well as advocates for those staying in the encampments, and ERP officials and providers; and\r\n5. Documents and records from City of Philadelphia and other sources, and media coverage related to ERP and Kensington",
