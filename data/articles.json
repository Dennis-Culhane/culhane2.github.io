    "abstract": "This study merged data from the 2015 Housing Inventory Count, a list of temporary housing programs serving homeless persons nationally, and the Internal Revenue Service Form 990 tax filings for nonprofit organizations that same year. Matching records were used to develop estimates of various organizational measures per bed, adjusting for outliers, including revenues by source, expenditures by type, number of employees, employee compensation, and number of volunteers. Average values of these measures per bed by program type and by target population were extrapolated to the overall inventory to generate sector-wide estimates. Based on various measures of central tendency and after addressing outliers, a best guess of total revenues for nonprofit temporary housing providers is estimated at approximately $8.5 billion in 2015. As many as 160,000 people are employed by nonprofit shelters, or 0.4 persons per bed, with average annual compensation of approximately $24,000. Universal bed coverage for unsheltered persons is estimated to cost an additional $3.3$4.5 billion annually.",

    "abstract": "Although several studies have examined the trend toward the decreasing differentiation of non-profit from for-profit general hospitals, few have focused on freestanding psychiatric hospitals. This study updates previous research that used psychiatric hospital data from the calendar year 1986 with data from 1990. In addition, a preliminary examination of the influence of market competition on the behavior of non-profit psychiatric facilities was conducted. Results confirm a converging trend between for-profit and non-profit facilities that is related, in part, to competition.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study compared health and social characteristics of two groups of homeless adults in Manhattanthose who were chronically unsheltered and those who were not. Methods: Outreach workers conducted brief, structured interviews with 1,093 unsheltered homeless adults. Respondents were later categorized as being chronically unsheltered on the basis of New York City criteria (sleeping without shelter at least nine of the previous 24 months). Results: The sample had high rates of substance abuse (65%), serious medical issues (42%), and repeated trauma (51%) and low rates of medical insurance (47%) and income entitlements (26%) entitlements. Sixty-seven percent were chronically unsheltered, and these respondents had significantly higher rates on several measures, including military service, incarceration, and mental illness. Conclusions: The sick and aged nature of this population suggests that more aggressive efforts are needed to enroll unsheltered homeless people in income and health benefits and to create adequate housing opportunities with appropriate support services.

Using administrative records from the VA and the New York City Department of Homeless Services, we compared the characteristics of users of VA and mainstream homeless programs and examined between-group differences in VA inpatient and outpatient services use and within-group changes in services use prior and subsequent to onset of homelessness. Roughly 41 percent of veterans only used mainstream homeless services. There were no significant differences between users of VA and mainstream homeless services in terms of gender,age, ethnicity, and level of VA eligibility. Veterans who used only mainstream homeless assistance services were less likely to be engaged withand made less intensive use ofVA health and behavioral health inpatient and outpatient services than those who used VA homeless services. Efforts should be made to identify and engage veterans who, while enrolled in VA healthcare, may go unidentified as homeless by the VA.",

    "abstract": "On July 22, 2003 (68 FR 43430), HUD published a draft Notice that described the data and technical standards for implementing Homeless Management Information Systems, HMIS. An HMIS is a computerized data collection application that facilitates the collection of information on homeless individuals and families using residential or other homeless assistance services and stores that data in an electronic format. Because an HMIS has the capacity to integrate data from all homeless service providers in the community and to capture basic descriptive information on every person served, it is a valuable resource for communities. HMIS can be employed to: better understand the characteristics of homeless persons in the community, including their demographic characteristics, patterns of homelessness, and use of services; improve the delivery of housing and services to specific sub-populations such as veterans or persons experiencing chronic homelessness; and assess and document the communitys progress in reducing homelessness.",

Using survival analysis methods, time since prison release and history of residential instability were the most salient risk factors related to shelter use, and shelter use increased the risk of subsequent reincarcerations.",
