    "abstract": "Research is limited about whether and to what extent registered sexoffenders (RSOs) face an increased risk of housing instability. The intersection of RSO and housing instability is particularly salient forveterans as there are disproportionately higher rates of veterans amongboth RSOs and homeless populations. This study assessed the relationshipbetween RSO status and risk of housing instability and homelessness among military veterans. We matched a list of 373,774 RSOs obtained from publicly available sex offender registries in 19 states with a cohort of 5.9 million veterans who responded to a brief screening for housing instability administered throughout the Veterans Health Administration between 2012 and 2016. Logistic regression estimated adjusted odds of any housing instability and homelessness among veterans identified as RSOs. Veterans identified as RSOs had 1.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.462.25) and 2.97 (95% CI 1.675.17) times greater odds of reporting any housing instability and homelessness, respectively, than non-RSOs. Findings represent some of the strongest evidence to date for the high risk of housing instability and homelessness among RSOs, suggesting a clear gap in policy and programmatic responses to their unique housing needs. Evidence-based alternative approaches to residence restriction laws may reduce recidivism and protect public safety.",

    "abstract": "Background: Individuals experiencing homelessness have higher hospitalization and mortality rates compared with the housed. Whether they also experience higher readmission rates, and if readmissions vary by region or cause of hospitalization is unknown.Objective: Evaluate the association of homelessness with readmission rates across multiple US states.Design: Retrospective analysis of administrative claims PATIENTS: All inpatient hospitalizations in Florida, Massachusetts, and New York from January 2010 to October 2015 MAIN MEASURES: Thirty- and 90-day readmission rates KEY RESULTS: Out of a total of 23,103,125 index hospitalizations, 515,737 were for patients who were identified as homeless at the time of discharge. After adjusting for cause of index hospitalization, state, demographics, and clinical comorbidities, 30-day and 90-day readmission rates were higher for index hospitalizations in the homeless compared with those in the housed group. The difference in 30-day readmission rates between homeless and housed groups was the largest in Florida (30.4% vs. 19.3%; p < 0.001), followed by Massachusetts (23.5% vs. 15.2%; p < 0.001) and New York (15.7% vs. 13.4%; p < 0.001) (combined 17.3% vs. 14.0%; p < 0.001). Among the most common causes of hospitalization, 30-day readmission rates were 4.1 percentage points higher for the homeless group for mental illness, 4.9 percentage points higher for diseases of the circulatory system, and 2.4 percentage points higher for diseases of the digestive system.Conclusions: After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, homelessness is associated with significantly higher 30- and 90-day readmission rates, with a significant variation across the three states. Interventions to reduce the burden of readmissions among individuals experiencing homelessness are urgently needed. Differences across states point to the potential of certain public policies to impact health outcomes for individuals experiencing homelessness.",

The present neighborhood investigation included 1,801 block groups comprising a large, northeastern metropolitan area. Common factor analyses and multistage, hierarchical cluster analyses yielded two dimensions (i.e., Social Stress, Structural Danger) and two typologies (i.e., Racial Composition, Property Structure Composition) of neighborhood context. Simultaneous multiple regression analyses revealed small but statistically significant associations between neighborhood variables and academic outcomes for public school kindergarten children.",

    "abstract": "The literature on deinstitutionalization (DI) and state hospitals is consistent in several areas: patient censuses at state facilities declined, staffing ratios increased, costs decreased with a net savings for state treasuries, and the number of state hospitals remained fairly constant or declined slightly. However, virtually all studies use data collected after DI had begun and span only a few years. This articles reports the results of data that spanned 39 years. Comparisons were made to examine the effects of DI on utilization, staffing and costs (inflation and population adjusted) at state hospitals. Newly opened hospitals greatly outnumbered closed facilities over the time frame, thus there were considerably more hospitals in 1988 than in 1949. The data also confirm that state hospitals have emerged from DI as different institutions with a new treatment emphasis refected in shorter stays and professionalized staff. However, this comes at a greatly increased cost.",

Recent initiatives by the state are described that have provided a context for systems change. Some of the challenges posed by the current program are discussed, particularly the lack of cost containment, and the resulting fact that significant public resources are spent supporting long-term stays in shelters and motels, which are not good for families or children. After an exploration of funding and resource issues, the paper concludes by establishing the foundation for changing the current system into one that would be outcome oriented, driven by the objective of housing stabilization and serve families in a more timely, effective and efficient manner.",

The Veterans Health Administration administers a universalhomelessness screener, which identifies housing status for Veterans screening positive forhomelessness. Methods. This study compared unsheltered and sheltered Veterans, assesseddifferences in rates of ongoing homelessness, and estimated a mixed- effect logistic regressionmodel to examine the relationship between housing status and ongoing homelessness.Results. Eleven percent of Veterans who screened positive for homelessness were unsheltered;40% of those who rescreened were homeless six months later, compared with lessthan 20% of sheltered Veterans. Unsheltered Veterans were 2.7 times as likely to experienceongoing homelessness. Discussion. Unsheltered Veterans differ from their sheltered counterpartsthey are older, more likely to be male, less likely to have incomeand may begood candidates for an intensive housing intervention. Future research will assess clinicalcharacteristics and services utilization among this population.",

Recurrent use of public shelters, exposure to domestic violence, older age at first episode of homelessness, and larger number of children in a household were associated with an increased risk of child welfare involvement. The high rate of crossover between homelessness and the child welfare system suggests the need for service coordination for children in homeless families.",

This study used the administrative data from two New York City agencies: the Administration for Childrens Services and the Department of Homeless Services. Overall, 29% had a childhood child welfare history, and 21% (74% of those with childhood child welfare histories) had histories of out-of-home placement through the child welfare system. Childhood out-of-home placement was associated with an increased number of days spent in shelters among family shelter users and with an increased likelihood of experiencing repeated shelter stays during early adulthood in both the family shelter and single-adult shelter groups. These findings underscore the need for more extensive support and housing services during early adulthood for persons with childhood child welfare histories.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. Veterans are overrepresented within the homeless population compared with their non-veteran counterparts, particularly when controlling for poverty. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) aims to prevent new episodes of homelessness by targeting households at greatest risk; however, there are no instruments that systematically assess veterans risk of homelessness. We developed and tested a brief screening instrument to identify imminent risk of homelessness among veterans accessing VA health care.Methods. The study team developed initial assessment items, conducted cognitiveinterviews with veterans experiencing homelessness, refined pilot items based on veterans and experts feedback and results of psychometric analyses, and assigned weights to items in the final instrument to indicate a measure of homelessness risk.Results. One-third of veterans who responded to the field instrument reported imminent risk of homelessness (i.e., housing instability in the previous 90 days or expected in the next 90 days). The reliability coefficient for the instrument was 0.85, indicating good internal consistency. Veterans who had a recent change in income, had unpaid housing expenses, were living temporarily withfamily and friends, needed help to get or keep housing, and had poor rental and credit histories were more likely to report a risk of homelessness thanthose who did not.Conclusion. This study provides the field with an instrument to identify individuals and households at risk of or experiencing homelessness, which is necessary to prevent and end homelessness. In addition, it supports VAs investment in homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing services for veterans who are experiencing or are at risk for homelessness.",
