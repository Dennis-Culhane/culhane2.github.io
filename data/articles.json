    "abstract": "Objectives. This study reports findings from the first-ever systematic enumeration of homeless population size using data previously collected from administrative records of homeless services providers in nine US jurisdictions over a one year period. As such, it provides the basis for establishing an ongoing measure of the parameters of the homeless population and for tracking related trends on the use of homeless services over time.Methods. Each participating jurisdiction collected data through its homeless services management information systems for persons and families who use emergency shelter and transitional housing. The jurisdictions organized the data by a standardized reporting format. These data form the basis for reporting homeless population size, both in raw numbers and as adjusted for each jurisdictions overall population size, as well as the rate of turnover and average annual length of stay in emergency shelters and transitional housing.Results. Individual jurisdictions had annual rates of sheltered homelessness ranging from 0.1% to 2.1% of their overall population, and 1.3% to 10.2% of their poverty population. Annual population size was 2.5 to 10.2 times greater than the point-prevalent population size. Results are broken down for adults and families.Conclusions. The prevalence of homelessness varies greatly among the jurisdictions included in this study, and possible factors for this diversity are discussed. Future reports of this nature will furnish similar series of homeless enumerations across a growing number of jurisdictions, thereby providing a basis for exploring the effects of different contextual factors on local prevalence rates of homelessness.",

    "abstract": "Because of pandemic-related disruptions to counts of unsheltered homeless people in January 2021, these findings focus on people experiencing sheltered homelessness. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, HUD encouraged communities to determine whether conducting an unsheltered PIT count posed a high risk of exacerbating COVID-19 transmissions, given the lack of widespread access to COVID-19 vaccines at the time. Many CoCs chose to not conduct an unsheltered PIT count because their capacity to conduct counts was limited due to other pandemic-response efforts and the risk of transmitting COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness, homeless assistance staff, and volunteers. There were 226 communities that conducted either complete or partial counts of unsheltered homelessness, but those communities are not representative of all communities across the United States.On a single night in 2021, more than 326,000 people were experiencing sheltered homelessness in the United States. Six in ten were individualsthat is, people in households with only adults or in households with only children. Four in ten were people in families with children. The number of people staying in sheltered locations decreased by eight percent between 2020 and 2021. While this continues a decline that began in 2015, the drop between 2020 and 2021 was steeper than those in recent years. A possible cause for sheltered reduction is that some emergency shelter providers increased the amount of space between people sleeping in congregate settings to reduce their risk of exposure, leading to fewer beds in congregate shelters. Other potential factors that led to the decrease: peoples reluctance to use available shelter beds because of health risk, and eviction moratoria, and cash transfers that may have reduced inflow into homelessness. It appears that the unsheltered population did not increase within the communities that conducted unsheltered counts. However, trends on unsheltered homelessness are known for just over half of communities, which accounted for only 22 percent of unsheltered homelessness in 2020.",

    "abstract": "This study examines services use and related costs for two cohorts of General Relief (GR) recipients in Los Angeles County. The study is made possible by the creation of the Adult Linkages Project (ALP), a data warehouse containing data on the GR recipients that spans eight Los Angeles County departments. This integration of data sources and County departments enables a unique window into the comprehensive use of County services by GR recipients, and allows for the exploration of hidden costs that GR recipients incur to Los Angeles County. The identification of such services use patterns forms the basis for service interventions that can provide GR recipients with more efficient, more effective, and more coordinated services.The GR recipients for this analysis belong to one of two cohorts. The first cohort, referred to as the first-time user cohort, contains all persons who were certified to receiveGR benefits for the first time in the first quarter of 2006. The second cohort, referred to as the long-term user cohort, is comprised of persons who had been certified for GR services prior to 2006, did not use any GR services in 2005, and were re-certified for GR in the first or second quarter of 2006. The data on receipt of GR benefits spans the time period January 2006 through October 2007. Data from other County services often spans longer time periods, meaning that data on services use is available prior to the date GR assistance was initiated and in most cases also after the last month of GR receipt in the time period.The study is divided into five sections. The first section is the longest, and examines the services use by the GR cohorts across Department of Public Social Services and six other County departments. In the second section, these findings across individual departments are integrated to provide a more comprehensive view of the extent and costs of County services to these cohorts, and identify heavy services users among these cohorts. The third section looks at the extent to which certain recipient characteristics, including disability, homelessness, and employment, affect the propensity to use County services. The fourth section provides a geographic analysis of GR receipt. Finally, the fifth section discusses implications for policy and research based on these findings.",

This linear model assumption precludes the possibility of inflection points in homeless rates - thresholds in quantifiable metrics of a community which, once breached, are associated with large increases in homelessness. In this paper, we identifying points of structural change in the relationship between homeless rates and community-level measures of housing affordability and extreme poverty. We develop a Dirichlet process mixture model that allows clusters of communities with similar features to exhibit common patterns of variation in homeless rates. A main finding of the study is that the expected homeless rate in a community increases sharply once median rental costs exceed 32% of median income, providing empirical evidence for the widely used definition of a housing cost burden at 30% of income. The Dirichlet process model also generates clusters that share common characteristics and exhibit distinct geographic patterns - yielding insight into the homelessness and housing affordability crises in large metropolitan areas on both coasts of the United States.",

Propensity score matching was used to select a matched control group to those identified as having been homeless between 1997 and 2003. Behavioral health services utilization was then assessed based on Medicaid claims records. Results. Substantially higher levels of behavioral health services use and corresponding costs were found among heads of families with a history of shelter use. Conclusions. Greater use of behavioral health services by heads of homeless families may reflect greater severity of disorders or a greater likelihood to seek treatment relative to what has been suggested by previous research.",

    "abstract": "Policy makers and advocates in industrialised economies have increasingly couched arguments for addressing homelessness in cost-offset paradigms. In the USA, there is a robust body of evidence demonstrating cost offsets of supportive housing, whereas rigorous evidence from the UK, Europe and Australia is limited. The present article contributes to the evidence base with results drawn from a linked administrative data-set including: police, prison, probation, parole, courts, emergency department, hospital admitted patients, ambulance, mental health and homelessness services data. The results show that in twelve months when people were homeless, they used on average $48,217 (25,776) worth of government services; in the twelve months as tenants of supportive housing, the cohort used on average, including the cost of supportive housing, $35,117 (18,773) in government services. Although social work only infrequently draws on cost arguments to substantiate practice and intervention, the article argues that cost-offset evidence is consistent with social works commitment to evidence base practice. Moreover, analysis of services that people use when securely housed compared to homeless adds further evidence to demonstrate that peoples actions, and their status as clients, is mediated by resources and opportunities available.",

Community-level factors accounted for 25% to 50% of the variance in homelessness rates across models. In metropolitan regions, alcohol consumption, social support, and several economic indicators were uniquely associated with family homelessness, and drug use and homicidewere uniquely associatedwith single-adult homelessness. In nonmetropolitan regions, life expectancy, religious adherence, unemployment, and rent burden were uniquely associated with family homelessness, and health care access, crime, several economic indicators, and receipt of Supplemental Security Income were uniquely associated with single-adult homelessness.Conclusions.

    "abstract": "Many efforts have been made to develop segregation indices that incorporate spatial interaction based on the contiguity concept. Contiguity refers to how similar the concentration of the subject of interest in one areal unit is to that in adjacent areal units. However, highly segregated situations are typically considered to be isolated sections or enclaves rather than smoothly formed peaks of concentration in space. Therefore, highly segregated enclaves may not exhibit contiguity. In this paper, a new index to measure the degree of clustering is developed and it is compared with the existing indices of concentration or segregation. The proposed clustering index (7C) tends to give more weight to 'enclaveness' rather than contiguity alone. This may be a good property for those cases in which the primary concern of an investigator is the formation of enclaves of a socioeconomic subject, including minority populations, poverty, crime, epidemics, and mortgage red-lining. Additionally, its property of robustness to the citywide rate allows us to perform properly an intercity comparison of a given subject by index score even when the citywide rate varies significantly, unlike the other measures.",

The lack of a prevention-oriented policy framework has resulted in responses to homelessness that focus primarily on assisting those who have already lost their housing and, consequently, to the institutionalization of homelessness. Recent Federal legislation, however, signals an emergent paradigm shift towards prevention-based approaches to homelessness. This paper explores the conceptual underpinnings of successful prevention initiatives and reviews practice-based evidence from several successful prevention-oriented approaches to homelessness in the United States and Europe. We then outline a conceptual framework for a transformation of homeless assistance towards prevention oriented approaches, with a discussion of relevant issues of program design and practice, data collection standards, and program performance monitoring and evaluation.",

However, there has been a 56% decline in the average length of stay; with both privately and publicly funded programs showing proportional shifts to more acute care. An increse in the number of long-stay \"day care\" programs may be attributable to educational and rehabilitation programs that report as partial-care providers.

In response, FEMA provides Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) to victims of housing loss. However, the extent to which sheltering needs are met by TSA has not been investigated, especially among low-income households. Analyzing FEMAs administrative data including all damaged housing units in Harris and Galveston counties (N = 283,085), we found that low-income victims of housing loss not only had greatersheltering needs but also were less likely to access TSA than their counterparts not of low-income status. When both groups were in need of shelter, the chance of obtaining TSA for low-income victims of housing loss was much lower than that for their counterparts. Our study highlights the critical sheltering needs of low-income households in a natural disaster, and advocates for a broader and more equitable distribution of TSA.",

We model an owners decision to abandon his or her property as being similar to an investors decision to exercise a put option on a financial instrument.

    "abstract": "Homelessness has long been recognised as a global phenomenon, affecting poorer populations in both the developed and developing worlds. However, acute housing need has often struggled to achieve the same level of priority at an international level as the satisfaction of other basic needs, such as for food, water, healthcare and education. In this paper we present a broad-based Global Homelessness Framework as a means of providing a frame of reference for cross-national engagement in this field, but recommend that concerted international action focuses on a relatively narrow definition of homelessness encompassing people without any form of accommodation (the unsheltered group who are sleeping rough or in places not intended for human habitation) and those living in temporary or crisis accommodation specifically provided for homeless people. We demonstrate that current data is insufficient to generate a comprehensive and defensible worldwide count of homeless people, and set out proposals to facilitate moves towards more reliable homelessness estimates at local, national and global levels. At the same time, however, we argue that at least some meaningful trend data is already available for large parts of the Global North, and for some countries and cities in the Global South, so that it would be both feasible and valuable to systematically track these directions of travel over time.",

The intersection of RSO and housing instability is particularly salient forveterans as there are disproportionately higher rates of veterans amongboth RSOs and homeless populations. This study assessed the relationshipbetween RSO status and risk of housing instability and homelessness among military veterans. We matched a list of 373,774 RSOs obtained from publicly available sex offender registries in 19 states with a cohort of 5.9 million veterans who responded to a brief screening for housing instability administered throughout the Veterans Health Administration between 2012 and 2016. Logistic regression estimated adjusted odds of any housing instability and homelessness among veterans identified as RSOs. Veterans identified as RSOs had 1.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.462.25) and 2.97 (95% CI 1.675.17) times greater odds of reporting any housing instability and homelessness, respectively, than non-RSOs. Findings represent some of the strongest evidence to date for the high risk of housing instability and homelessness among RSOs, suggesting a clear gap in policy and programmatic responses to their unique housing needs. Evidence-based alternative approaches to residence restriction laws may reduce recidivism and protect public safety.",

    "abstract": "Background: Individuals experiencing homelessness have higher hospitalization and mortality rates compared with the housed. Whether they also experience higher readmission rates, and if readmissions vary by region or cause of hospitalization is unknown.Objective: Evaluate the association of homelessness with readmission rates across multiple US states.Design: Retrospective analysis of administrative claims PATIENTS: All inpatient hospitalizations in Florida, Massachusetts, and New York from January 2010 to October 2015 MAIN MEASURES: Thirty- and 90-day readmission rates KEY RESULTS: Out of a total of 23,103,125 index hospitalizations, 515,737 were for patients who were identified as homeless at the time of discharge. After adjusting for cause of index hospitalization, state, demographics, and clinical comorbidities, 30-day and 90-day readmission rates were higher for index hospitalizations in the homeless compared with those in the housed group. The difference in 30-day readmission rates between homeless and housed groups was the largest in Florida (30.4% vs. 19.3%; p < 0.001), followed by Massachusetts (23.5% vs. 15.2%; p < 0.001) and New York (15.7% vs. 13.4%; p < 0.001) (combined 17.3% vs. 14.0%; p < 0.001). Among the most common causes of hospitalization, 30-day readmission rates were 4.1 percentage points higher for the homeless group for mental illness, 4.9 percentage points higher for diseases of the circulatory system, and 2.4 percentage points higher for diseases of the digestive system.Conclusions: After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, homelessness is associated with significantly higher 30- and 90-day readmission rates, with a significant variation across the three states. Interventions to reduce the burden of readmissions among individuals experiencing homelessness are urgently needed. Differences across states point to the potential of certain public policies to impact health outcomes for individuals experiencing homelessness.",

Comparisons were made to examine the effects of DI on utilization, staffing and costs (inflation and population adjusted) at state hospitals. Newly opened hospitals greatly outnumbered closed facilities over the time frame, thus there were considerably more hospitals in 1988 than in 1949. The data also confirm that state hospitals have emerged from DI as different institutions with a new treatment emphasis refected in shorter stays and professionalized staff. However, this comes at a greatly increased cost.",

Overall, 29% had a childhood child welfare history, and 21% (74% of those with childhood child welfare histories) had histories of out-of-home placement through the child welfare system. Childhood out-of-home placement was associated with an increased number of days spent in shelters among family shelter users and with an increased likelihood of experiencing repeated shelter stays during early adulthood in both the family shelter and single-adult shelter groups. These findings underscore the need for more extensive support and housing services during early adulthood for persons with childhood child welfare histories.",

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) aims to prevent new episodes of homelessness by targeting households at greatest risk; however, there are no instruments that systematically assess veterans risk of homelessness. We developed and tested a brief screening instrument to identify imminent risk of homelessness among veterans accessing VA health care.Methods. The study team developed initial assessment items, conducted cognitiveinterviews with veterans experiencing homelessness, refined pilot items based on veterans and experts feedback and results of psychometric analyses, and assigned weights to items in the final instrument to indicate a measure of homelessness risk.Results. One-third of veterans who responded to the field instrument reported imminent risk of homelessness (i.e., housing instability in the previous 90 days or expected in the next 90 days). The reliability coefficient for the instrument was 0.85, indicating good internal consistency. Veterans who had a recent change in income, had unpaid housing expenses, were living temporarily withfamily and friends, needed help to get or keep housing, and had poor rental and credit histories were more likely to report a risk of homelessness thanthose who did not.Conclusion. This study provides the field with an instrument to identify individuals and households at risk of or experiencing homelessness, which is necessary to prevent and end homelessness. In addition, it supports VAs investment in homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing services for veterans who are experiencing or are at risk for homelessness.",

    "abstract": "This paper documents expenditure and revenue patterns of state mental health agencies from 1981 to 1987. Expenditure data show an overall decline of mental health expenditures of 4.9% over this period. States with declining overall expenditures were more likely to make deep cuts in hospital expenditures and little or no increases in community programs, while the few states with increasing expenditures showed substantial increases in community programs and contant funding for hospitals. A relatively more dramatic shift was noted across states of shifting expenditures from inpatient to ambulatory care. Revenue data reveal that federal support for state mental health agencies increased slightly during this period, but solely as a function of the introduction of the Block Grant in 1982. However, once introduced, both the Block Grant and other federal sources show steady losses against inflation. State sources also show a decline of 4% during this period, most of which was felt between 1981 and 1983, after which there has been no further decreases. Interstate variability in percapita spending on mental health is described and found to significant even beyond adjustments for costs of services. Expenditures on mental health also show relatively greater declines compared to overall state budgets and state health and welfare budgets during this period, suggesting an increasingly lower priority for mental health services in the state budget alloction process.",

The midpoint of the estimates would yield an estimate of 1.8% of all families (572,000 households) being homeless for at least one day during 1996.

    "abstract": "Although several studies have examined the trend toward the decreasing differentiation of non-profit from for-profit general hospitals, few have focused on freestanding psychiatric hospitals. This study updates previous research that used psychiatric hospital data from the calendar year 1986 with data from 1990. In addition, a preliminary examination of the influence of market competition on the behavior of non-profit psychiatric facilities was conducted. Results confirm a converging trend between for-profit and non-profit facilities that is related, in part, to competition.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study compared health and social characteristics of two groups of homeless adults in Manhattanthose who were chronically unsheltered and those who were not. Methods: Outreach workers conducted brief, structured interviews with 1,093 unsheltered homeless adults. Respondents were later categorized as being chronically unsheltered on the basis of New York City criteria (sleeping without shelter at least nine of the previous 24 months). Results: The sample had high rates of substance abuse (65%), serious medical issues (42%), and repeated trauma (51%) and low rates of medical insurance (47%) and income entitlements (26%) entitlements. Sixty-seven percent were chronically unsheltered, and these respondents had significantly higher rates on several measures, including military service, incarceration, and mental illness. Conclusions: The sick and aged nature of this population suggests that more aggressive efforts are needed to enroll unsheltered homeless people in income and health benefits and to create adequate housing opportunities with appropriate support services.

Using administrative records from the VA and the New York City Department of Homeless Services, we compared the characteristics of users of VA and mainstream homeless programs and examined between-group differences in VA inpatient and outpatient services use and within-group changes in services use prior and subsequent to onset of homelessness. Roughly 41 percent of veterans only used mainstream homeless services. There were no significant differences between users of VA and mainstream homeless services in terms of gender,age, ethnicity, and level of VA eligibility. Veterans who used only mainstream homeless assistance services were less likely to be engaged withand made less intensive use ofVA health and behavioral health inpatient and outpatient services than those who used VA homeless services. Efforts should be made to identify and engage veterans who, while enrolled in VA healthcare, may go unidentified as homeless by the VA.",

    "abstract": "On July 22, 2003 (68 FR 43430), HUD published a draft Notice that described the data and technical standards for implementing Homeless Management Information Systems, HMIS. An HMIS is a computerized data collection application that facilitates the collection of information on homeless individuals and families using residential or other homeless assistance services and stores that data in an electronic format. Because an HMIS has the capacity to integrate data from all homeless service providers in the community and to capture basic descriptive information on every person served, it is a valuable resource for communities. HMIS can be employed to: better understand the characteristics of homeless persons in the community, including their demographic characteristics, patterns of homelessness, and use of services; improve the delivery of housing and services to specific sub-populations such as veterans or persons experiencing chronic homelessness; and assess and document the communitys progress in reducing homelessness.",

Using survival analysis methods, time since prison release and history of residential instability were the most salient risk factors related to shelter use, and shelter use increased the risk of subsequent reincarcerations.",
