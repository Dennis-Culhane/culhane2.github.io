    "abstract": "Part 2 of the 2018 AHAR builds on the Part 1 report by presenting estimates of people experiencing sheltered homelessness at any point over the course of a year, based on data from HMIS. The HMIS estimates provide information on demographics and patterns of shelter use of people who use the nationâs emergency shelters, safe havens, and transitional housing programs. The report also provides demographic information about people who transitioned from homelessnessâeither sheltered or unshelteredâto permanent supportive housing (PSH) and rapid rehousing (RRH) during this same one-year period.\r\n\r\nKey Findings:\r\n\r\nâ¢ In 2018, an estimated 1,446,000 people in the U.S. experienced sheltered homelessness at some point during the year.\r\nâ¢ Nearly two-thirds were in households with only adults. Thirty-five percent of people who experienced homelessness were in families with children. A small share (only one percent) were in child-only households.\r\nâ¢ Black or African American people were considerably overrepresented among people experiencing homelessness. While representing 13 percent of all U.S. heads of households and 22 percent of heads of households living in poverty, people identifying as black accounted for 43 percent of heads of sheltered\r\nhouseholds in 2018.\r\nâ¢ Nearly one in five heads of households and other adults using shelters had a chronic pattern of homelessness (18%). One in every ten sheltered adults was a veteran.",

    "abstract": "On a single night in 2018, roughly 553,000 people were experiencing homelessness in the United States. About two-thirds (65%) were staying in sheltered locations—emergency shelters or transitional housing programs—and about one-third (35%) were in unsheltered locations such as on the street, in abandoned buildings, or in other places not suitable for human habitation. Homelessness increased (though modestly) for the second year in a row. The number of homeless people on a single night increased by 0.3 percent between 2017 and 2018. The increase reflects declines in the number of people staying in emergency shelters and transitional housing programs being offset by increases in the number of people staying in unsheltered locations. Between 2017 and 2018, the unsheltered population increased by two percent (or 4,300 people).",
