    "abstract": "This article assesses the extent and predictors of homelessness among veterans (both veterans in families with children and single adults veterans) exiting the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, which is a nationwide homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing programgeared primarily toward those experiencing crisis homelessness.Among rapid re-housing participants, 16%and 26%of single adult veterans experienced an episode of homelessness at 1 and 2 years post-SSVF exit; the comparable figures at those follow-up times for veterans in familieswere 9.4%and 15.5%, respectively. Relatively fewer single adult veterans and veterans in families receiving homelessness prevention services experienced an episode of homelessness at 1 and 2 years post-SSVF exit. veteran-level characteristics, including age, gender, prior history of homelessness, and recent engagement with U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care, were generally more salient predictors of homelessness following SSVF exit than variables measuring SSVF program factors or community-level housing market conditions.",

    "abstract": "Amidst concern about the implications of an aging U.S. population, recent evidence suggests that there is a unique aging trend among the homeless population. Building on this, we use data from New York City and from the last three decennial Census enumerations to assess how the age composition of the homeless populationÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂboth single adults and adults in familiesÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhas changed over time. Findings show diverging trends in aging patterns for single adults and adults in families over the past 20 years. Among single adults, the bulk of the sheltered population is comprised of persons born during the latter part of the baby boom era whose high risk for homelessness has continued as they have aged. Specifically, the age group in this population facing the highest risk for homelessness was 34ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ36 (born 1954ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ1956) in 1990; 37ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ42 (born 1958ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ1963) in 2000; and 49ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ51 (born 1959ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ1961) in 2010. In contrast, among adults in sheltered families, there is no indication of any progressive aging of the family household heads. The modal age across the study period remains at 21ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ23 years of age. We consider implications for the health care and social welfare systems, and policy responses to homelessness.",

    "abstract": "In April 2020, the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) conducted a national survey of local homeless assistance coordinating agencies, or Continuums of Care, to understand the impacts of COVID-19 and how communities have responded to this unprecedented public health crisis. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International concern and on February 11, 2020 the WHO announced the name of the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19 (WHO, 2020). By mid-March, starting with California, in almost every state in the United States, persons were encouraged to Ã¢ÂÂshelter in placeÃ¢ÂÂ and to practice Ã¢ÂÂsocial distancingÃ¢ÂÂ to flatten the growth curve of infection to allow hospitals and emergency health care resources to adequately keep pace with those experiencing acute medical crises (Baral et al., 2020). Asking citizens to Ã¢ÂÂshelter in placeÃ¢ÂÂ and practice Ã¢ÂÂsocial distancingÃ¢ÂÂ created an unprecedented urgency for communities across the country to respond to the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in the face of this crisis (Doran et al., 2020; Lima et al., 2020; Tsai & Wilson, 2020).\r\nPrimary concerns that quickly emerged across the nation were:\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ How to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness who become infected with COVID-19\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ How to provide adequate shelter to prevent COVID-19 infection among medically vulnerable persons experiencing homelessness (over 65, underlying health conditions)\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ How to address shelter density in existing congregate shelters to comply with CDC guidance for social distancing in shelters (110 sq ft per person)\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ How to address the health and safety of unsheltered persons including people in encampments, in light of the crisis;\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ How to protect staff who serve persons experiencing homelessness\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ How to acquire financial resources and PPE supplies to address the needs of people who are homeless\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ How to coordinate screening, testing, tracking and contact tracing with community partners. The responses to this survey provide an understanding of how communities through their CoCs have responded to COVID-19 in the first 4-6 weeks of the crisis.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all individuals experiencing chronic homelessness could be eligible for Medicaid in states pursuing Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Given that many of these individuals are at risk for high health care utilization and costs, state and federal policymakers and budget officials are increasingly interested in cost-effective approaches to meet the needs of this population. In July 2015, the Center for Health Care Strategies, with support from the California HealthCare Foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, and the New York State Health Foundation, convened state and federal officials along with research and policy experts to identify strategies for expanding access to housing and related services for Medicaid beneficiaries who are chronically homeless. This brief highlights key opportunities for Medicaid programs to better address the housing needs of this high-need, high-cost population.",

    "abstract": "The use of public shelters in Philadelphia was examined both before and after the implementation of Act 35, Pennsylvania’s response to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Univariate interrupted time-series analyses were conducted to determine if trends in shelter utilization (the number of families admitted, by family size, by race, by age of household head, by income, by disability indicator, and by average length of stay) changed significantly after March 1997, the month in which Act 35 was implemented, or after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of implementation. Results indicate that family size and household head age increased after the implementation of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, although not at consistent lags. A small negative effect on self-reported substance abuse and a small positive effect on the proportion of household heads with a disability were found, but at inconsistent lags.",
