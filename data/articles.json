    "abstract": "This study investigates hypotheses regarding the association of census tract variables with the risk for homelessness. We used prior address information reported by families entering emergency shelters in two large U.S. cities to characterize the nature of that distribution.Three dense clusters of homeless origins were found in Philadelphia and three in New York City, accounting for 67 percent and 61 percent of shelter admissions and revealing that homeless families prior addresses are more highly concentrated than the poverty distribution in both cities. The rate of shelter admission is strongly and positively related to the concentration of poor, African-American, and female-headed households with young children in a neighborhood. It is also correlated with fewer youth, elderly, and immigrants. Such areas have higher rates of unemployment and labor force nonparticipation, more housing crowding, more abandonment, higher rates of vacancy, and higher rent-to-income ratios than other areas.",

Computerized records of client characteristics and their related shelter utilization patterns offer researchers a rich source of longitudinal data that makes possible a wide range of investigations and can be analyzed by using an array of multivariate statistical tools. Specifically, this article discusses the contributions administrative data can make to (1) enumerating and determining the characteristics of the homeless population, (2) understanding the effect of homelessness on related public systems, (3) gauging the effect of policy interventions on the use of homeless services, (4) evaluating the effectiveness of system-level delivery of homeless services, and (5) measuring the performance of individual homeless service providers.The article concludes by commenting on several issues that policy makers might consider regarding the implementation of automated information systems among homeless service providers.",

    "abstract": "Equity assessments, like those described in this working paper, have historical roots in the Civil Rights movement. As part of demands for equitable access to jobs, resources, and services, communities of color and Civil Rights advocates pressed public and private institutions to document the representation of racial and ethnic groups (National Archives, 2016). Corrective action plans were used to develop clear strategies to redress inequities and hold institutions accountable to change. Affirmative action policies reinforced these strategies by requiring certain groups, such as federal contractors, to develop numerical targets and timelines to correct for underutilization of services by marginalized groups (Legal Information Institute, n.d.).Human service agencies are now being called upon once again to address inequities within their programs. In January 2021, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, which requires federal agencies to identify methods for assessing equity within federal programs and to engage communities historically underserved or discriminated against in these programs (Exec. Order No. 13985, 2021). This working paper strives to build upon the aims of the Civil Rights movement to help human service agencies estimate and respond to racial and ethnic inequities in their service provision. The urgency of this work is underscored not only by the executive order, but also by the long overdue social unrest around racialized violence and inequity in the U.S. and the stark racial disparities in experience and outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic.The following sections of this paper outline three phases of workperforming a gaps analysis (measuring gaps between need for and current availability of services), interpreting the gaps analysis (assessing root causes of the problem and strategizing responses), and co-creating an equity plan (determining next steps and implementing strategies to correct for inequities). Importantly, community organizations and those with lived experiences of the systems under consideration need to be engaged throughout this entire process. See AToolkit for Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration for more (Hawn Nelson et al., 2020a). In addition, the general process provided here will need to be customized based on the social issue of interest, local context, available data, and resource constraints. Drawing upon multiple data sources, types of expertise, and stakeholder perspectives is highly recommended in order to robustly assess and respond to inequities in service provision. Altogether, these methods can inform social policymaking and support human serviceagencies in more equitable resource allocation and service provision.",

    "abstract": "The economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened demand for cross-agency data capacity, as policymakers are forced to reconcile the need for expanded services with extreme fiscal constraints. In this context, integrated data systems (IDS) also commonly referred to as data hubs, data collaboratives, or state longitudinal data systems are a valuable resource for data-informed decision making across agencies. IDS utilize standard governance processes and legal agreements to grant authority for routine, responsible use of linked data, and institutionalize roles across partners with shared priorities. Despite these benefits, creating and sustaining IDS remains a challenge for many states. Legislation and executive action can be powerful mechanisms to overcome this challenge and promote the use of cross-agency data for public good.This brief is organized in three parts. First, we offer examples of approaches from states that have used legislation and/or executive orders to enable data integration, as well as key considerations related to each. Second, we discuss state and federal funding opportunities that can help in implementing legislative or executive actions on data sharing and enhancing long-term sustainability of data sharing efforts. Third, we offer five foundational strategies to ensure that legislative or executive action is both ethical and effective.",

Evidence suggests that adverse health outcomes lead to homelessness, and the conditions related to homelessness lead to or exacerbate a range of health problems (Hwang, 2001). In addition, the barriers to accessing preventative and primary care while homeless lead to receipt of healthcare only when morbidities are more acute, (Reid, Vittinghoff, & Kushel, 2008; Kushel, Gupta, Gee, & Haas, 2006; Lim, Andersen, Leake, Cunningham, & Gelberg, 2002) meaning that there is a disproportionate use of inpatient hospitalization and other costly medical and behavioral health services among persons experiencing homelessness (Doran et al., 2013; Hwang, Weaver, Aubry, & Hoch, 2011; Kushel, Perry, Bangsberg, Clark, & Moss, 2002; Salit, Kuhm & Hartz, 1998). As a result, homelessness is expensive for healthcare systems and for society as a whole (Latimer et al., 2017; Flaming, Burns, & Matsunaga, 2009; Culhane, 2008). Given this, interest in using healthcare systems as a platform to address homelessness has grown in recent years. Strategies include efforts to identify homelesspatients in healthcare settings in order to link them with housing and social services (Garg, Toy, Tripodis,Silverstein, & Freeman, 2015; Gottlieb, Hessler, Long, Amaya, & Adler, 2014); the creation of accountable care organizations that seek to coordinate healthcare and social services for persons experiencing housing instability (Mahadevan & Houston, 2015); and the development of new financing mechanisms geared towards using healthcare dollars to support housing stability (Burt, Wilkins, & Locke, 2014).",

    "abstract": "While in the US a large volume of quantitative impact studies on homelessness has been generated over many years, homelessness researchers in the UK have tended to be concerned, at least until recently, with more qualitative and conceptual forms of exploration and evaluation. This contrast between the US and UK extant homelessness literatures can be traced back to the different research traditions that have emerged over the years on opposite sides of the Atlantic (Fitzpatrick and Christian, 2006). In the UK, applied housing studies specialists have tended to dominate academic research on homelessness, with the important role played by domestic legislation in tackling homelessness in the UK also meaning that there is a strong tradition of socio-legal scholarship in this field (Cowan, 2019). More theoretical contributions in the UK, as in the US, often emerge from urban geography or sociology perspectives (Lancione, 2013), although a sharply contrasting conceptual approach within the UK now sees mainstream moral philosophy applied to the ethical challenges and dilemmas that abound in homelessness policy and practice (Watts et al, 2017). Health-orientated research on homelessness has generally been relatively marginal to the policy debate in the UK, not least because it is often very narrowly focused (for example on oral health or blood-borne viruses among specific homeless subpopulations). That said, there is now increasing engagement from UK-based public health specialists in the complex needs of homeless people who face compounding problems of substance misuse, mental ill-health and/or involvement in the criminal justice system (Aldridge et al, 2018; Luchenski et al, 2018). In the US, by contrast, psychological, sociological and medical perspectives have long played a central role in homelessness research, along with significant contributions from social policy and economics scholars. The prominence of these clinical perspectives, and a more quantitative approach in the social sciences more generally, has engendered a research tradition heavily slanted toward statistical research and policy and programme evaluation. Here we explore the UK and US traditions with a view to identifying how new opportunities presented by developments in the field might help forge a path to better homelessness research and, more importantly, better homelessness responses.",

    "abstract": "An Increasingly Urgent Problem Collides with the Challenging Realities of a Pandemic. The implementation framework provided here builds on a March 24, 2020 report prepared by the CEOs Office of Homeless Initiative (HI), which provides the basic contours for an Older Adult Housing Pilot that would seek to permanently house all willing homeless adults who are at least 65 years of age. The HIs report, however, represents deliberations and the realities of Los Angeles Countys homeless services system prior to the onset of the coronavirus public health emergency. The implications of the pandemic have unfolded contemporaneously with the development of a pilot implementation approach and created some challenges for the pilot planning process during the past six months, particularly in terms of questions about pilot funding sources. While some details have gradually come into sharper focus over this period, a number of key issues remain unresolved at the present time, and the availability of some previously assumed funding sources has been deferred until Year Two of the pilot, at the earliest.Within this fluid context, the plan we offer in this report - the projected population for which is shown in Figure 1, along with the costs associated with serving these clients - represents a necessary modification of our initial plan but also reflects the persistence of a basic tension: While COVID-19 temporarily, but indefinitely, places restrictions on the use of previously-available resources, older adult homelessness is a growing and increasingly expensive problem, one likely to worsen in the absence of a systematic and coordinated intervention. More immediately, the heightened risk of complications and fatality for older adults who become infected with the coronavirus adds to the urgency of moving homeless older adults from the streets to the safety of permanent housing.",

Given this, interest in using healthcare systems as a platform to address homelessness has grown in recent years. Strategies include efforts to identify homelesspatients in healthcare settings in order to link them with housing and social services (Garg, Toy, Tripodis,Silverstein, & Freeman, 2015; Gottlieb, Hessler, Long, Amaya, & Adler, 2014); the creation of accountable care organizations that seek to coordinate healthcare and social services for persons experiencing housing instability (Mahadevan & Houston, 2015); and the development of new financing mechanisms geared towards using healthcare dollars to support housing stability (Burt, Wilkins, & Locke, 2014).",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, we address the epidemiology of homelessness among US Veterans, including a discussion of the methodological challenges relevant to the enumeration and description of homelessness as well as a presentation of current estimates and trends in homelessness among Veterans. The chapter begins with a brief overview of homelessness among Veterans historically, with the remainder of the chapter focusing on the prevalence and incidence of homelessness among Veterans over the past decade. The methodological considerations discussed in this chapter include issues surrounding conceptual definitions of homelessness, implications related to the time frame used for estimates, a comparison between point prevalence, period prevalence, and incidence, and a description of various approaches for using primary and administrative data to estimate the magnitude and composition of homelessness among Veterans. Finally, we present recent national estimates of the prevalence and incidence of homelessness among Veterans, along with a summary of trends over time, and segmentation of estimates by demographic, geographic, and housing status characteristics.",

Efforts begun in the 1980s and 1990s by individual cities are discussed, as are the Congressional initatives that led to the mandated implementation of such systems in the US. The use of these systems for the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to the US Congress is described, as are potential future uses of HMIS for research, policy and program planning.",

    "abstract": "While in the US a large volume of quantitative impact studies on homelessness has been generated over many years, homelessness researchers in the UK have tended to be concerned, at least until recently, with more qualitative and conceptual forms of exploration and evaluation. This contrast between the US and UK extant homelessness literatures can be traced back to the different research traditions that have emerged over the years on opposite sides of the Atlantic (Fitzpatrick and Christian, 2006). In the UK, applied housing studies specialists have tended to dominate academic research on homelessness, with the important role played by domestic legislation in tackling homelessness in the UK also meaning that there is a strong tradition of socio-legal scholarship in this field (Cowan, 2019). More theoretical contributions in the UK, as in the US, often emerge from urban geography or sociology perspectives (Lancione, 2013), although a sharply contrasting conceptual approach within the UK now sees mainstream moral philosophy applied to the ethical challenges and dilemmas that abound in homelessness policy and practice (Watts et al, 2017). Health-orientated research on homelessness has generally been relatively marginal to the policy debate in the UK, not least because it is often very narrowly focused (for example on oral health or blood-borne viruses among specific homeless subpopulations). That said, there is now increasing engagement from UK-based public health specialists in the complex needs of homeless people who face compounding problems of substance misuse, mental ill-health and/or involvement in the criminal justice system (Aldridge et al, 2018; Luchenski et al, 2018). In the US, by contrast, psychological, sociological and medical perspectives have long played a central role in homelessness research, along with significant contributions from social policy and economics scholars. The prominence of these clinical perspectives, and a more quantitative approach in the social sciences more generally, has engendered a research tradition heavily slanted toward statistical research and policy and programme evaluation. Here we explore the UK and US traditions with a view to identifying how new opportunities presented by developments in the field might help forge a path to better homelessness research and, more importantly, better homelessness responses.",

    "abstract": "The European Parliament recently passed a Written Declaration calling for an ambitious EU homelessness strategy and support to Member States in their efforts towards ending homelessness (FEANTSA, December 21, 2010). The Written Declaration comes on the heels of a consensus conference on homelessness held in Brussels, in which researchers from the European Observatory (some featured in this volume) made the moral and empirical case for urgent and strategic action by all member countries of the EU. This leadership has proven to be critically influential as the European Commission moves forward with its antipoverty goals for 2020. This timely volume will help bring further momentum to this cause, by framing much of what has been learned, and many of the important questions yet to be addressed in this highly complex, multinational context.",

    "abstract": "An Increasingly Urgent Problem Collides with the Challenging Realities of a Pandemic. The implementation framework provided here builds on a March 24, 2020 report prepared by the CEOs Office of Homeless Initiative (HI), which provides the basic contours for an Older Adult Housing Pilot that would seek to permanently house all willing homeless adults who are at least 65 years of age. The HIs report, however, represents deliberations and the realities of Los Angeles Countys homeless services system prior to the onset of the coronavirus public health emergency. The implications of the pandemic have unfolded contemporaneously with the development of a pilot implementation approach and created some challenges for the pilot planning process during the past six months, particularly in terms of questions about pilot funding sources. While some details have gradually come into sharper focus over this period, a number of key issues remain unresolved at the present time, and the availability of some previously assumed funding sources has been deferred until Year Two of the pilot, at the earliest.Within this fluid context, the plan we offer in this report - the projected population for which is shown in Figure 1, along with the costs associated with serving these clients - represents a necessary modification of our initial plan but also reflects the persistence of a basic tension: While COVID-19 temporarily, but indefinitely, places restrictions on the use of previously-available resources, older adult homelessness is a growing and increasingly expensive problem, one likely to worsen in the absence of a systematic and coordinated intervention. More immediately, the heightened risk of complications and fatality for older adults who become infected with the coronavirus adds to the urgency of moving homeless older adults from the streets to the safety of permanent housing.",
