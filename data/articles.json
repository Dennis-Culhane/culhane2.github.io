    "abstract": "In this book we present a new approach to promoting more effective, efficient, and ethical intergovernmental decision making and problem solvinga system we call actionable intelligence for social policy (AISP). Actionable Intelligence (AI) is neither data nor research, although it involves both. It is derived from the combined contributions from executive leaders, practitioners, researchers, and citizens. It requires intergovernmental coordination and collaboration among bureaucracies. It is what is needed to inform disciplined, evidence-based decision making. We developed the AISP model to address the major limitations to traditional approaches to American public administration identified in the literature.Actionable Intelligence is a robust integrated data system (IDS)IDS integrates individual citizens data across agencies to provide scientifically sound, intergovernmental information to inform AIAI can provide a comprehensive picture of the whole person and has the potential of bringing everyone from health, education, and humans service agencies together around one tableThrough the use of an IDS, data-sharing agencies can contribute their clients data to one collaborative process to achieve a more thorough understanding of a pressing social problem and what to do about it",
