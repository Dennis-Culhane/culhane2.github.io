    "abstract": "This study examines services use and related costs for two cohorts of General Relief (GR) recipients in Los Angeles County. The study is made possible by the creation of the Adult Linkages Project (ALP), a data warehouse containing data on the GR recipients that spans eight Los Angeles County departments. This integration of data sources and County departments enables a unique window into the comprehensive use of County services by GR recipients, and allows for the exploration of hidden costs that GR recipients incur to Los Angeles County. The identification of such services use patterns forms the basis for service interventions that can provide GR recipients with more efficient, more effective, and more coordinated services.\r\n\r\nThe GR recipients for this analysis belong to one of two cohorts. The first cohort, referred to as the first-time user cohort, contains all persons who were certified to receive\r\n\r\nGR benefits for the first time in the first quarter of 2006. The second cohort, referred to as the long-term user cohort, is comprised of persons who had been certified for GR services prior to 2006, did not use any GR services in 2005, and were re-certified for GR in the first or second quarter of 2006. The data on receipt of GR benefits spans the time period January 2006 through October 2007. Data from other County services often spans longer time periods, meaning that data on services use is available prior to the date GR assistance was initiated and in most cases also after the last month of GR receipt in the time period.\r\n\r\nThe study is divided into five sections. The first section is the longest, and examines the services use by the GR cohorts across Department of Public Social Services and six other County departments. In the second section, these findings across individual departments are integrated to provide a more comprehensive view of the extent and costs of County services to these cohorts, and identify heavy services users among these cohorts. The third section looks at the extent to which certain recipient characteristics, including disability, homelessness, and employment, affect the propensity to use County services. The fourth section provides a geographic analysis of GR receipt. Finally, the fifth section discusses implications for policy and research based on these findings.",

    "abstract": "This report responds to a motion from the Board of Supervisors to develop a plan that will house all homeless adults age 65 years and older (65+). Projections of homelessness in Los Angeles and across the country show that the number of older homeless adults is likely to growÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂin many places more than doublingÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂover the next several years as a result of a cohort effect described elsewhere in this report. This plan is thus very well timed, as it allows Los Angeles County to get ahead of this problem as it threatens to worsen throughout the next decade.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies that quantify the relationship between homeless rates and features of a community typically assume a global linear relationship. This linear model assumption precludes the possibility of inflection points in homeless rates - thresholds in quantifiable metrics of a community which, once breached, are associated with large increases in homelessness. In this paper, we identifying points of structural change in the relationship between homeless rates and community-level measures of housing affordability and extreme poverty. We develop a Dirichlet process mixture model that allows clusters of communities with similar features to exhibit common patterns of variation in homeless rates. A main finding of the study is that the expected homeless rate in a community increases sharply once median rental costs exceed 32% of median income, providing empirical evidence for the widely used definition of a housing cost burden at 30% of income. The Dirichlet process model also generates clusters that share common characteristics and exhibit distinct geographic patterns - yielding insight into the homelessness and housing affordability crises in large metropolitan areas on both coasts of the United States.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. This study compares the use of and cost for behavioral health services among heads of homeless and housed poor families. Methods. Medicaid records for 59,135 heads of families receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families benefits were matched with data from Philadelphiaâs municipal shelter system. Propensity score matching was used to select a matched control group to those identified as having been homeless between 1997 and 2003. Behavioral health services utilization was then assessed based on Medicaid claims records. Results. Substantially higher levels of behavioral health services use and corresponding costs were found among heads of families with a history of shelter use. Conclusions. Greater use of behavioral health services by heads of homeless families may reflect greater severity of disorders or a greater likelihood to seek treatment relative to what has been suggested by previous research.",

    "abstract": "Policy makers and advocates in industrialised economies have increasingly couched arguments for addressing homelessness in cost-offset paradigms. In the USA, there is a robust body of evidence demonstrating cost offsets of supportive housing, whereas rigorous evidence from the UK, Europe and Australia is limited. The present article contributes to the evidence base with results drawn from a linked administrative data-set including: police, prison, probation, parole, courts, emergency department, hospital admitted patients, ambulance, mental health and homelessness services data. The results show that in twelve months when people were homeless, they used on average $48,217 (£25,776) worth of government services; in the twelve months as tenants of supportive housing, the cohort used on average, including the cost of supportive housing, $35,117 (£18,773) in government services. Although social work only infrequently draws on cost arguments to substantiate practice and intervention, the article argues that cost-offset evidence is consistent with social work’s commitment to evidence base practice. Moreover, analysis of services that people use when securely housed compared to homeless adds further evidence to demonstrate that people’s actions, and their status as clients, is mediated by resources and opportunities available.",
