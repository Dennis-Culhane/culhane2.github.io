    "abstract": "For most homelessness service providers, the number of clients who are eligible for long-term housing outstrips the availability.This study uses a cohort of housing assessments taken from a mid-size county in the US and machine learning methods to train a Predictive Risk Model (PRM) that identifies clients who would experience multiple adversities in the future. The PRM outperforms the Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) in flagging clients at the greatest risk of adversities. The proposed method can be readily used by any Continuum of Care (CoC) that holds electronic housing assessments and service records.",

We modeled rates of family and single-adult homelessness in the United States in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions and as a function of community-level demographic, behavioral, health, economic, and safety net characteristics.Methods. We entered community-level characteristics and US Department of Housing and Urban Development point-in-time counts for a single night in January 2009 into separate mixed-effects statistical analyses that modeled homelessness rates for 4 subpopulations: families and single adults inmetropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions.Results. Community-level factors accounted for 25% to 50% of the variance in homelessness rates across models. In metropolitan regions, alcohol consumption, social support, and several economic indicators were uniquely associated with family homelessness, and drug use and homicidewere uniquely associatedwith single-adult homelessness. In nonmetropolitan regions, life expectancy, religious adherence, unemployment, and rent burden were uniquely associated with family homelessness, and health care access, crime, several economic indicators, and receipt of Supplemental Security Income were uniquely associated with single-adult homelessness.Conclusions. Considering homeless families and single adults separately enabled more precise modeling of associations between homelessness rates and community-level characteristics, indicating targets for interventions to reduce homelessness among these subpopulations.",

The high rate of crossover between homelessness and the child welfare system suggests the need for service coordination for children in homeless families.",

    "abstract": "Many efforts have been made to develop segregation indices that incorporate spatial interaction based on the contiguity concept. Contiguity refers to how similar the concentration of the subject of interest in one areal unit is to that in adjacent areal units. However, highly segregated situations are typically considered to be isolated sections or enclaves rather than smoothly formed peaks of concentration in space. Therefore, highly segregated enclaves may not exhibit contiguity. In this paper, a new index to measure the degree of clustering is developed and it is compared with the existing indices of concentration or segregation. The proposed clustering index (7C) tends to give more weight to 'enclaveness' rather than contiguity alone. This may be a good property for those cases in which the primary concern of an investigator is the formation of enclaves of a socioeconomic subject, including minority populations, poverty, crime, epidemics, and mortgage red-lining. Additionally, its property of robustness to the citywide rate allows us to perform properly an intercity comparison of a given subject by index score even when the citywide rate varies significantly, unlike the other measures.",

    "abstract": "Prevention has long been cited as an important part of any strategy to end homelessness. Nonetheless, effective prevention initiatives have proven difficult to implement in practice. The lack of a prevention-oriented policy framework has resulted in responses to homelessness that focus primarily on assisting those who have already lost their housing and, consequently, to the institutionalization of homelessness. Recent Federal legislation, however, signals an emergent paradigm shift towards prevention-based approaches to homelessness. This paper explores the conceptual underpinnings of successful prevention initiatives and reviews practice-based evidence from several successful prevention-oriented approaches to homelessness in the United States and Europe. We then outline a conceptual framework for a transformation of homeless assistance towards prevention oriented approaches, with a discussion of relevant issues of program design and practice, data collection standards, and program performance monitoring and evaluation.",

Contrary to two recent reports describing declining support for partial hospitalization, data from the National Institute of Mental Health's Inventory of Mental Health Organizations reveal that the number of \"partial-care\" providers increased by 20% between 1984 and 1988, with increases occurring among privately and publicly funded programs. However, there has been a 56% decline in the average length of stay; with both privately and publicly funded programs showing proportional shifts to more acute care. An increse in the number of long-stay \"day care\" programs may be attributable to educational and rehabilitation programs that report as partial-care providers. Future study is proposed to create a better typology of partial-hospitalization programs.",

In response, FEMA provides Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) to victims of housing loss. However, the extent to which sheltering needs are met by TSA has not been investigated, especially among low-income households. Analyzing FEMAs administrative data including all damaged housing units in Harris and Galveston counties (N = 283,085), we found that low-income victims of housing loss not only had greatersheltering needs but also were less likely to access TSA than their counterparts not of low-income status. When both groups were in need of shelter, the chance of obtaining TSA for low-income victims of housing loss was much lower than that for their counterparts. Our study highlights the critical sheltering needs of low-income households in a natural disaster, and advocates for a broader and more equitable distribution of TSA.",

We model an owners decision to abandon his or her property as being similar to an investors decision to exercise a put option on a financial instrument. When required to pay delinquent taxes, a wealth-maximizing landlord has an incentive to cede ownership of his or her residential property when the value of all outstanding liens exceeds the propertys market value. Estimates from the model are used to examine whether empirical evidence supports this option model of abandonment.",

    "abstract": "Homelessness has long been recognised as a global phenomenon, affecting poorer populations in both the developed and developing worlds. However, acute housing need has often struggled to achieve the same level of priority at an international level as the satisfaction of other basic needs, such as for food, water, healthcare and education. In this paper we present a broad-based Global Homelessness Framework as a means of providing a frame of reference for cross-national engagement in this field, but recommend that concerted international action focuses on a relatively narrow definition of homelessness encompassing people without any form of accommodation (the unsheltered group who are sleeping rough or in places not intended for human habitation) and those living in temporary or crisis accommodation specifically provided for homeless people. We demonstrate that current data is insufficient to generate a comprehensive and defensible worldwide count of homeless people, and set out proposals to facilitate moves towards more reliable homelessness estimates at local, national and global levels. At the same time, however, we argue that at least some meaningful trend data is already available for large parts of the Global North, and for some countries and cities in the Global South, so that it would be both feasible and valuable to systematically track these directions of travel over time.",

The intersection of RSO and housing instability is particularly salient forveterans as there are disproportionately higher rates of veterans amongboth RSOs and homeless populations. This study assessed the relationshipbetween RSO status and risk of housing instability and homelessness among military veterans. We matched a list of 373,774 RSOs obtained from publicly available sex offender registries in 19 states with a cohort of 5.9 million veterans who responded to a brief screening for housing instability administered throughout the Veterans Health Administration between 2012 and 2016. Logistic regression estimated adjusted odds of any housing instability and homelessness among veterans identified as RSOs. Veterans identified as RSOs had 1.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.462.25) and 2.97 (95% CI 1.675.17) times greater odds of reporting any housing instability and homelessness, respectively, than non-RSOs. Findings represent some of the strongest evidence to date for the high risk of housing instability and homelessness among RSOs, suggesting a clear gap in policy and programmatic responses to their unique housing needs. Evidence-based alternative approaches to residence restriction laws may reduce recidivism and protect public safety.",

Whether they also experience higher readmission rates, and if readmissions vary by region or cause of hospitalization is unknown.Objective: Evaluate the association of homelessness with readmission rates across multiple US states.Design: Retrospective analysis of administrative claims PATIENTS: All inpatient hospitalizations in Florida, Massachusetts, and New York from January 2010 to October 2015 MAIN MEASURES: Thirty- and 90-day readmission rates KEY RESULTS: Out of a total of 23,103,125 index hospitalizations, 515,737 were for patients who were identified as homeless at the time of discharge. After adjusting for cause of index hospitalization, state, demographics, and clinical comorbidities, 30-day and 90-day readmission rates were higher for index hospitalizations in the homeless compared with those in the housed group. The difference in 30-day readmission rates between homeless and housed groups was the largest in Florida (30.4% vs. 19.3%; p < 0.001), followed by Massachusetts (23.5% vs. 15.2%; p < 0.001) and New York (15.7% vs. 13.4%; p < 0.001) (combined 17.3% vs. 14.0%; p < 0.001). Among the most common causes of hospitalization, 30-day readmission rates were 4.1 percentage points higher for the homeless group for mental illness, 4.9 percentage points higher for diseases of the circulatory system, and 2.4 percentage points higher for diseases of the digestive system.Conclusions: After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, homelessness is associated with significantly higher 30- and 90-day readmission rates, with a significant variation across the three states. Interventions to reduce the burden of readmissions among individuals experiencing homelessness are urgently needed. Differences across states point to the potential of certain public policies to impact health outcomes for individuals experiencing homelessness.",

Comparisons were made to examine the effects of DI on utilization, staffing and costs (inflation and population adjusted) at state hospitals. Newly opened hospitals greatly outnumbered closed facilities over the time frame, thus there were considerably more hospitals in 1988 than in 1949. The data also confirm that state hospitals have emerged from DI as different institutions with a new treatment emphasis refected in shorter stays and professionalized staff.

    "abstract": "An analysis of 8,251 homeless children in New York City found that 18% of them received child welfare services over the five-year period following their first shelter admission, and an additional 6% had a history of having received such services before their first shelter admission. Recurrent use of public shelters, exposure to domestic violence, older age at first episode of homelessness, and larger number of children in a household were associated with an increased risk of child welfare involvement. The high rate of crossover between homelessness and the child welfare system suggests the need for service coordination for children in homeless families.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the prevalence of childhood experiences with child welfare supervision and placement among a cohort of 11,401 young sheltered homeless adults and assessed the associations between this prior involvement with child welfare services and the risk of experiencing recurrent and extended episodes of shelter use. This study used the administrative data from two New York City agencies: the Administration for Childrens Services and the Department of Homeless Services. Overall, 29% had a childhood child welfare history, and 21% (74% of those with childhood child welfare histories) had histories of out-of-home placement through the child welfare system. Childhood out-of-home placement was associated with an increased number of days spent in shelters among family shelter users and with an increased likelihood of experiencing repeated shelter stays during early adulthood in both the family shelter and single-adult shelter groups. These findings underscore the need for more extensive support and housing services during early adulthood for persons with childhood child welfare histories.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. Veterans are overrepresented within the homeless population compared with their non-veteran counterparts, particularly when controlling for poverty. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) aims to prevent new episodes of homelessness by targeting households at greatest risk; however, there are no instruments that systematically assess veterans risk of homelessness. We developed and tested a brief screening instrument to identify imminent risk of homelessness among veterans accessing VA health care.Methods. The study team developed initial assessment items, conducted cognitiveinterviews with veterans experiencing homelessness, refined pilot items based on veterans and experts feedback and results of psychometric analyses, and assigned weights to items in the final instrument to indicate a measure of homelessness risk.Results. One-third of veterans who responded to the field instrument reported imminent risk of homelessness (i.e., housing instability in the previous 90 days or expected in the next 90 days). The reliability coefficient for the instrument was 0.85, indicating good internal consistency. Veterans who had a recent change in income, had unpaid housing expenses, were living temporarily withfamily and friends, needed help to get or keep housing, and had poor rental and credit histories were more likely to report a risk of homelessness thanthose who did not.Conclusion. This study provides the field with an instrument to identify individuals and households at risk of or experiencing homelessness, which is necessary to prevent and end homelessness. In addition, it supports VAs investment in homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing services for veterans who are experiencing or are at risk for homelessness.",

Using matched and aggregated administrative data from SSA and the New York City (NYC) Department of Homeless Services (DHS), we juxtapose aggregated earnings and shelter-use data for 160,525 sheltered adults during two decades of followup. If employment represents a shock of sufficient magnitude to precipitate homelessness, then these data should show associations between declines in employment and earnings and onset of shelter use. Furthermore, a correspondence between exits from homelessness and increases in employment levels and earnings would further underscore the ties between employment and homelessness.",

Women of Hope is one such program in Philadelphia, which was initiated to serve \"noncompliant,\" treatment-resistant homeless women with mental illness who have a history of living on the streets. Through aggressive outreach and a low-demand congregate housing program, Women of Hope has been successful in bringing 120 women of the streets. Residents are required neither to undergo treatment nor to stay in the program, but are encouraged over time to seek mental health services and medical treatment. Former residents can be found primarily in independent housing and secondarily in highly and moderately structured housing. A diverse range of housing types have been required to place residents, including use of the congregate housing program as a permanent option. Approximately 14% of the former residents have returned to living on the streets, but continue to receive outreach services.",

    "abstract": "This paper documents expenditure and revenue patterns of state mental health agencies from 1981 to 1987. Expenditure data show an overall decline of mental health expenditures of 4.9% over this period. States with declining overall expenditures were more likely to make deep cuts in hospital expenditures and little or no increases in community programs, while the few states with increasing expenditures showed substantial increases in community programs and contant funding for hospitals. A relatively more dramatic shift was noted across states of shifting expenditures from inpatient to ambulatory care. Revenue data reveal that federal support for state mental health agencies increased slightly during this period, but solely as a function of the introduction of the Block Grant in 1982. However, once introduced, both the Block Grant and other federal sources show steady losses against inflation. State sources also show a decline of 4% during this period, most of which was felt between 1981 and 1983, after which there has been no further decreases. Interstate variability in percapita spending on mental health is described and found to significant even beyond adjustments for costs of services. Expenditures on mental health also show relatively greater declines compared to overall state budgets and state health and welfare budgets during this period, suggesting an increasingly lower priority for mental health services in the state budget alloction process.",

The National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients (NSHAPC),1 conducted with homeless people using 16 types of homeless assistance programs in 76 geographical areas, is the only nationally representative data source available to estimate the number of families who are homeless in the United States. The NSHAPC estimated that family members made up 34% of the homeless population. Of this estimate, 23% were children and 11% were adults. These estimates, reflecting two different sampling points during 1996, suggest that 420,000 and 725,000 households respectively (1.3% - 2.2% percent of all families) were homeless at least one time during that year. The midpoint of the estimates would yield an estimate of 1.8% of all families (572,000 households) being homeless for at least one day during 1996. When just the poverty population is considered, the midpoint estimate indicates that 8% of poor families were homeless for at least one day during 1996.",

Average values of these measures per bed by program type and by target population were extrapolated to the overall inventory to generate sector-wide estimates. Based on various measures of central tendency and after addressing outliers, a best guess of total revenues for nonprofit temporary housing providers is estimated at approximately $8.5 billion in 2015. As many as 160,000 people are employed by nonprofit shelters, or 0.4 persons per bed, with average annual compensation of approximately $24,000.

Results: The sample had high rates of substance abuse (65%), serious medical issues (42%), and repeated trauma (51%) and low rates of medical insurance (47%) and income entitlements (26%) entitlements. Sixty-seven percent were chronically unsheltered, and these respondents had significantly higher rates on several measures, including military service, incarceration, and mental illness. Conclusions: The sick and aged nature of this population suggests that more aggressive efforts are needed to enroll unsheltered homeless people in income and health benefits and to create adequate housing opportunities with appropriate support services.

    "abstract": "Objective: Homelessness and patterns of service use were examined among seriously mentally ill persons in an area with a well-funded community- based mental health system. Methods: The sample consisted of 438 individuals referred between 1990 and 1992 to an extended acute care psychiatric hospital after a stay in a general hospital. Those experiencing an episode of homelessness, defined as an admission to a public shelter between 1990 and 1993, were compared with those who were residentially stable. Data from a longitudinal integrated database of public mental health and medical services were used to construct service utilization measures to test the mediating effect of outpatient mental health care on preventing homelessness. Results: A homelessness rate of 24 percent was found among the 438 persons with serious mental illness. Those who experienced homelessness were more likely to be African American, receive general assistance, and have a comorbid substance abuse problem. They used significantly more inpatient psychiatric, emergency, and health care services than the subjects who did not become homeless. Forty to 50 percent of the homeless group received outpatient care during the year before and after their shelter episode. The number of persons who received intensive case management services increased after shelter admission. Conclusions: An enhanced community-based mental health system was not sufficient to prevent homelessness among high-risk persons with serious mental illness. Eleven percent of this group experienced homelessness after referral to an extended acute care facility. Strategies to prevent homelessness should be considered, perhaps at the time of discharge from the referring community hospital or extended acute care facility.",

    "abstract": "This study examined whether children who become homeless differ from other low-income children in their mental health service use before and after their first homeless episode, and to what extent homelessness is associated with an increased likelihood of mental health service use. Differences between children with and without new onset of sheltered homelessness in the use of mental health services emerged following homelessness and widened over time. Sheltered homelessness and foster care placement history were associated with increased odds of receiving inpatient and ambulatory mental health services. Findings underscore the importance of collaborations between homeless assistance, foster care, and mental healthcare in efforts to mitigate family homelessness and collateral needs among homeless children.",

Fixed effects regression analyses are used to estimate the associations between four different housing contexts and four different behaviors related to transmitting HIV infections. Results showed that 16% of the study group experienced homelessness at some point during the study, and that homelessness was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of frequenting shooting galleries (odds ratio = 2.05), but did not have a significant effect on sharing syringes, sharing other injection drug paraphernalia, or participating in paid sex. These results provide limited support for positing homelessness as independently associated with increased levels of HIV-related risk behavior among injection drug users and highlights the need for more research that examines the housing dynamics among this population.",

Our framework integrates structural forcessuch as income inequality, an affordable housing shortage, social exclusion, and inadequate safety net programswith the personal circumstances and challenges that shape individuals homeless trajectories. The macro-micro perspective also helps us to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, and it highlights variation across contexts in how the dynamics of homelessness operate. In a separate section, we introduce the sixteen core articles of this volume against the macro-micro backdrop. Finally, we discuss two emergent macro shocks (the COVID-19 pandemic and climate-related hazards) that are largely absent from the volume but carry important implications for understanding and addressing homelessness in the future.",

A demonstration project initiated in 2010 to reform housing placement practices in a metropolitan area enabled researchers to compare an explicit Housing First programoffering immediate permanent housing without requiring treatment compliance, abstinence, or housing readinesswith a treatment-first program for 177 homeless Veterans. The Housing First initiative successfully reduced time to housing placement, from 223 to 35 days, housing retention rates were significantly higher among Housing First tenants, and emergency room use declined significantly among the Housing First cohort. The results suggest that a national Housing First model for the VA would be associated with improved outcomes for Veterans experiencing homelessness.",

However, the extent to which this relationship prevents homelessness has not been fully explored. This article looks at the effectiveness of outpatient services delivered to people within thirty days of discharge from psychiatric hospitalization. The sample consisted of homeless adults with mental illness, and the study assessed the reoccurrence of homelessness following hospital discharge. Prompt connection with aftercare services was effective in reducing homelessness for people who used the shelter system a single time in the year prior to their psychiatric hospitallization. For repeated users of the shelter system, the recurrence of homelessness was not correlated with timely outpatient services following hospital discharge. The study suggests that continuity of care is instrumental in prevent future homelessness among a portion of the homeless mentally ill population. For homeless mentally ill people with recent histories of repeated shelter use, greater diversity and intensity of outpatient services are necessary.",

We adjusted odds ratios for confounding variables.Results. After adjustment, individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 (P<.05) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession. Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjustedodds ratio increased to 5.45 (P<.05).Conclusions. On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.",

However, the homeless assistance systems in most countries are not adequately resourced to assist persons experiencing crisis homelessness, who account for the majority of the homeless population. Thus, we present a policy proposal for leveraging an expansion of Critical Time Intervention (CTI), an evidence-based behavioral health intervention, as a scalable solution for crisis homelessness. We draw on the specific policy context of the United States in proposing the use of funds from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income individuals, to finance such an expansion, but argue our broader policy proposal has salience internationally as well. In presenting our proposal, we discuss why it represents a sound and feasible policy idea, focusing on the alignment between CTI and a promising new programmatic approach known as rapid rehousing. We describe the potential benefits of enacting this proposal and conclude with discussing the United States-specific and more general challenges that would need to be addressed to implement it, including the need for additional resources to cover the costs of the temporary financial assistance component of rapid re-housing.",

The resulting shelter utilization rates reveal large disparities among age groups and across racial/ethnic groups, as well as showing different trends in shelter utilization among the two cities. Among the results reported, the rate of shelter utilization declined by 11% in New York City over this period, while the overall utilization rate in Philadelphia has increased to where it is 40% higher than that of New York City. Children under age 5, at a rate of 0.0248, have the highest shelter utilization rate among the age groups studied and the overall rate for blacks is 2.3 times that of the overall population. And while shelter utilization rates among single men have decreased by 30% in New York City, a similar decrease has not occurred among women of early childbearing ages or among young children. Finally, policy implications related to these findings are discussed.",

Survival analyses reveal that half of adult shelter users will stay fewer than 45 days over a two-year period (combined stays), and that approximately one half of men and one third of women will experience a readmission within two years of the first admission. Results also document the size and relative resource consumption of a long-term sheltered population, finding that 18.2 percent of New York shelter users stay 180 days or more in their first yea6 consuming 53.4 percent of the system days for first-time shelter users. Discrete-time logistic hazard regression analyses reveal that, in general, being older, of black race, having a substance abuse or mental health problem, or having a physical disability, significantly reduces the likelihood of exiting shelter. In both cities, people entering shelter in later years are staying longer, although individuals have shorter episodes on subsequent admissions. The implications of this study for the analysis and management of emergency shelter system utilization are discussed.",

Relying on an integrated data set, the associations between single- and multiple-system utilization and risk for dropping out, or actually dropping out of school, among youth in Grades 7 through 9 were examined. Results showed dropout rates more than doubled among public youth system users compared with those in the overall sample.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To examine the performance of 2 single-item screening questions assessing emergency department (ED) patients self-perceived risk of future homelessness.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of adult ED patients from 2016 to 2017 in a public hospital ED in New York City. Data were analyzed from September 2019 through October 2021. EXPOSURES Responses on patient surveys conducted at the baseline ED visit for 2 single-item screening questions on self-perceived risk for future housing instability and homelessness were collected. One question asked patients if they were worried about having stable housing in the next 2 months, and the other question asked them to rate the likelihood that they would enter a homeless shelter in the next 6 months. OUTCOMES Homeless shelter entry 2, 6, and 12 months after an ED visit, assessed using shelter administrative data in the study city, which was linked with participant baseline survey responses. RESULTS There were 1919 study participants (976 [51.0%] men and 931 [48.6%] women among 1915 individuals with gender data; 700 individuals aged 31-50 years [36.5%] among 1918 individuals with age data; 1126 Hispanic or Latinx individuals [59.0%], 368 non-Hispanic Black individuals [19.3%], and 225 non-Hispanic White individuals [11.8%] among 1908 individuals with race and ethnicity data). Within 2, 6, and 12 months of the ED visit, 45 patients (2.3%), 66 patients (3.4%), and 95 patients (5.0%) had entered shelter, respectively. For both single-item screening questions, participants who answered affirmatively had significantly higher likelihood of future shelter entry at each time point examined (eg, at 2 months: 31 participants responding yes [6.5%] vs 14 participants responding no [1.0%] to the question concerning being worried about having stable housing in the next 2 months). Sensitivity of the screening questions ranged from 0.27 to 0.69, specificity from 0.76 to 0.97, positive predictive value from 0.07 to 0.27, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.62 to 0.72. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that 2 single-item screening questions assessing ED patient self-perceived risk of future housing instability and homelessness had adequate to good performance in identifying risk for future shelter entry. Such single-item screening questions should be further tested before broad adoption.",

This report is based on 1,498 persons housed through Project Roomkey as of April 30, 2020. A total of 297 of these persons provided with emergency housing are at least 65 years of age (19.8 percent).A Long-Term Housing Strategy Built on Two Objectives, Thee Commitments, and a Familiar Model:This report recommends a strategic approach to transitioning older adults from Project Roomkey to long-term housing arrangements that adopts a variant of the Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) model as a basic framework and places a premium on health and safety from exposure to COVID-19. The strategy would pursue basic two objectives: Objective 1: Ensure all Project Roomkey clients are placed into safe permanent or interim housing upon moving out of the participating hotels and motels. Objective 2: Housing placements of older adults out of Project Roomkey must include services that effectively address client vulnerabilities.To achieve these objectives, the County and LAHSA must commit to the following through a coordinatedand collaborative effort with cities and with a broad range of stakeholders that straddle governmentjurisdictions: Where continued occupancy in hotels participating in Project Roomkey is not possible, immediate placement of all clients in permanent housing or a on a rapid path to permanent housing arrangements that are safe and do not introduce added health risks. Provision of Housing Stabilization Case Management Services to all clients, encompassing mainstream benefits enrollment (e.g. SSI, SSDI, GR, CalFresh), housing transition counseling, landlord negotiation, coordination of move-in assistance, and transition to community health and service supports. A flexible approach in fitting clients to a diverse range of possible long-term subsidized housing options on a client-by-client basis, one informed by specific needs and vulnerabilities and oriented around safety from potential COVID-19 exposure through opportunities for self-isolation and quarantine.",

Receipt of public assistance following discharge from care is one important indicator of the extent to which these youth experience economic difficulties, but prior research on the topic has a number of key limitations. Building on existing research, this study examines public assistance receipt following exit from care among a cohort of 7492 youth who were discharged from an out of home placement in Los Angeles County between 2002 and 2004 and who were aged 16 or above at their time of discharge. Results show that approximately28% of youth in the study sample received either CalWORKs, which is California's version of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, or General Relief (GR), which is LA County's general assistance program for indigent adults, at some point over the study's follow-up period. Additionally, crossover youth, who have a history of involvement in both the child welfare and juvenile justice systems are more likely than their counterparts who were only involved in the child welfare system to receive both types of public assistance. Differences in the risk profiles for GR and CalWORKs receipt centered around gender, as males were far less likely to receive CalWORKs but more likely to receive GR. Findings from this study provide additional evidence that older youth who age out of or otherwise exit foster care struggle to achieve economic self-sufficiency andalso suggest that crossover youth constitute a distinct sub-group of youth exiting foster care who should betargeted for specialized forms of assistance.",

In this population-based cohort study, we assessed baseline risk factors for homelessness, including the role of service in the Iraq or Afghanistan conflicts, among a large cohort of recent veterans.Methods. Data for this study came from administrative records for 310 685 veterans who separated from active military duty from July 1, 2005, to September 30, 2006. We used survival analysis methods to determine incidence rates and risk factors for homelessness, based on baseline data for military factors, demographic characteristics, and diagnoses of behavioral health disorders and traumatic brain injury.Results. Service in Iraq or Afghanistan and, more specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder among veterans deployed there, were significant risk factors of modest magnitude for homelessness, and socioeconomic and behavioral health factors provided stronger indicators of risk. Gender was not a significant indicator of differential risk.Conclusions. Although service in Iraq and Afghanistan was significant, socioeconomic and behavioral health indicators show more promise in efforts to use administrative data to inform prevention efforts by identifying veterans who are at elevated risk for becoming homeless upon their return to civilian life.",

    "abstract": "Research on mental illness in relation to social problems such as crime, unemployment, and homelessness often ignores the broader social context in which mental illness is embedded. Policy, research, and practice will be improved if greater attention is given to social context. The authors critically analyze the approach used in much of the psychiatric services literature to infer links between mental illness and social problems. They compare these studies with studies that have been more validly conceptualized to account for social context. With this broader perspective, the impact of mental illness on crime, unemployment, and homelessness appears to be much smaller than that implied by much of the psychiatric services literature. Poverty moderates the relationship between serious mental illness and social problems. Factors related to poverty include lack of education, problems with employment, substance abuse, and a low likelihood of prosocial attachments. This relationship is often complicated and is not amenable to simple explanations. Research and policy that take this complexity into account may lead to greater effectiveness in interventions for persons with serious mental illness.",

Methods: This study used shelter and street outreach records from a large U.S. city to identify 2,703 persons who met federal criteria for chronic homelessness during a three-year period. Identifiers for these persons were matched to administrative records for psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, and incarceration. Results: Twenty percent of the persons who incurred the highest costs for services ccounted for 60% of the total service costs of approximately $20 million a year (or approximately $12 million). Most of the costs for this quintile were for psychiatric care and jail stays. Eighty-one percent of the persons in the highest quintile had a diagnosis of a serious mental illness, and 83% of the persons in the lowest quintile had a history of substance abuse treatment without a diagnosis of a serious mental illness. Conclusions: Supportive housing models for people with serious mental illness who experience chronic homelessness may be associated with substantial cost offsets, because the use of acute care services diminishes in an environment of housing stability and access to ongoing support services. However, because persons with substance use issues and no recent history of mental health treatment used relatively fewer and less costly services, cost neutrality for these persons may require less service-intensive programs and smaller subsidies.",

    "abstract": "Several large US cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia, have developed information systems to distribute property-level housing data to community organizations and municipal agencies. These early warning systems are also intended to predict which properties are at greatest risk of abandonment, but they have rarely used statistical modeling to support such forecasts. This study used logistic regression to analyze data from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Information System in order to determine which properties were most likely to become imminently dangerous. Several different characteristics of the property, including whether it was vacant, had outstanding housing code violations, and tax arrearages as well as characteristics of nearby properties were identified as significant predictors. Challenges common to the development of early warning systems - including integrating administrative data, defining abandonment, and modeling temporal and spatial data - are discussed along with policy implications for cities like Philadelphia that have thousands of vacant and abandoned properties.",

The study specifically explores the significance of type of housing placement as a predictor variable for shelter reentry. Various demographic and family structure attributes are linked with shelter exit and reentry, including race and ethnicity, family size, age of family head, pregnancy status, and public assistance recipiency status. Although there is a trade-off between length of shelter stay and type of housing placement at shelter discharge, procuring subsidized housing is associated with a substantially lower probability of shelter readmission.

Further, differential disability profiles were found in each subgroup with the control of demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, race/ethnicity, free/reduced lunch, Limited English Proficiency, grade, and prior school absences), students with serious emotional disturbance and learning disabilities demonstrated amplified risks of being classified in the Chronic or Rising subgroups, which show chronic or incremental upward truant trajectories over time.

    "abstract": "IntroductionUnderstanding the prevalence of and risk for homelessness among veterans is prerequisite to preventing and ending homelessness among this population. Homeless veterans are at higher risk for chronic disease; understanding the dynamics of homelessness among veterans can contribute to our understanding of their health needs.MethodsWe obtained data on demographic characteristics and veteran status for 130,554 homeless people from 7 jurisdictions that provide homelessness services, and for the population living in poverty and the general population from the American Community Survey for those same jurisdictions. We calculated prevalence of veterans in the homeless, poverty, and general populations, and risk ratios(RR) for veteran status in these populations. Risk for homelessness, as a function of demographic characteristics and veteran status, was estimated by using multivariate regression models.ResultsVeterans were overrepresented in the homeless population, compared with both the general and poverty populations, among both men (RR, 1.3 and 2.1, respectively) and women(RR, 2.1 and 3.0, respectively). Veteran status and black race significantly increased the risk for homelessness for both men and women. Men in the 45- to 54-year-old age group and women in the 18- to 29-year-old age group were at higher risk compared with other ages.ConclusionOur findings confirm previous research associating veteran status with higher risk for homelessness and imply that there will be specific health needs among the aging homeless population. This study is a basis for understanding variation in rates of, and risks for, homelessness in general population groups, and inclusion of health data from US Department of Veterans Affairs records can extend these results to identifying links between homelessness and health risks.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes HMIS and American Community Survey data from seven jurisdictions to assess the prevalence and relative risk for homelessness among veterans by race, sex, age and poverty status. Results show that among the homeless population, approximately 14% of adult males and 2% of adult females are veterans. For males, this proportion is about 30% greater than the proportion of Veterans in the general population, and twice as large as the proportion of veterans in the population living below the poverty threshold. Similarly among the female homeless population, veterans are overrepresented compared to the general population by a factor of two, and by a factor of three when compared to the population living in poverty. The number of homeless veterans account for approximately 1% of male veterans and 2% of female veterans in the general population. These rates are higher for veterans identifying as black (4% for males, 5% for females). When looking only at veterans living below the poverty threshold, homeless veterans are 15% (regardless of sex) of this population, with this rate increasing to 30% when only looking at black veterans living in poverty. In multivariable analyses, veteran status was associated with increased risk of homelessness. For instance, after controlling for poverty, age, race, and geographic variation, female veterans are three times as likely as female non-Veterans to become homeless, and male Veterans are twice as likely as male non-veterans to become homeless. In terms of age, across the general homeless population (Veterans and non-Veterans), males have the highest risk for homelessness in the 4554 year age group. For females, risk for homelessness is highest among the 1829 year age group and risk declines as age increases. Black race (compared to all others) is consistently identified as a strong risk factor for homelessness, with little variation across sex.",

A series of matched controls who were homeless but not placed in housing were similarly tracked. Regression results reveal that persons placed in supportive housing experience marked reductions in shelter use, hospitalizations, length of stay per hospitalization, and time incarcerated. Before placement, homeless people with severe mental illness used about $40,451 per person per year in services (1999 dollars). Placement was associated with a reduction in services use of $16,281 per housing unit per year. Annual unit costs are estimated at $17,277, for a net cost of $995 per unit per year over the first two years.",

These programs do not directly address the causes of homelessness, and residents are exposed to victimization and trauma during stays. We need an alternative that is more humane, as well as more efficient and effective at achieving outcomes. Purpose: This article uses research on homelessness to devise alternative forms of emergency assistance that could reduce the prevalence and/or duration of episodes of homelessness and much of the need for emergency shelter. Methods: We review analyses of shelter utilization patterns to identify subgroups of homeless single adults and families with minor children, and propose alternative program models aimed at the particular situations of each of these subgroups. Results and conclusions: We argue that it would be both more efficient and more humane to reallocate resources currently devoted to shelters. We propose the development of community-based programs that instead would focus on helping those with housing emergencies to remain housed or to quickly return to housing, and be served by mainstream social welfare programs. We advocate providing shelter on a limited basis and reserving transitional housing for individuals recently discharged from institutions. Chronic homelessness should be addressed by permanent supportive housing.",

The potential for linking administrative data across multiple systems further allows for a more comprehensive view of various subpopulations, their patterns of services use and their associated costs. Because people who experience homelessness are often users of multiple systems, and are often homeless in part because of ineffective programs and insufficient aftercare, these data may be crucial to identifying the gaps that need to be filled to prevent and reduce the duration of homelessness spells. These data can also make visible what may otherwise be hidden and understudied aspects of the homelessness problem. The use of administrative data for purposes for which they were not originally intended also raises some ethical issues that must be considered in light of their potential to be misused.",

    "abstract": "Like social scientists everywhere, homelessness researchers in the US are usually ignored. Good science that identifies what causes homelessness, sound evaluations which document that certain programs will never work, and even evidence that promising solutions deserve broad replication, are often disregarded. Such wanton indifference for science would constitute malpractice in the field of medicine, but it sometimes passes as acceptable policy in the field of social welfare. Ideology, politics and preservation of the status quo usually prevail. So, whats a well intentioned researcher to do? Persevere and become more tactical. After all, policy failures cant be ignored forever. Like good advocates, researchers too have to be opportunistic. We have to find the right kind of audiences for our work, and perhaps even more importantly, we have to do the kind of work that will get us the right audiences.",

    "abstract": "Many Hispanic households in the United States face poor housing conditions, high rent burdens, overcrowding, andin some communitieshigh rates of homelessness. At the same time, awareness is growing that Hispanics are often underrepresented in housing and homelessness assistance programs relative to their poverty rate and compared with other groups with similar needs. This realization raises two immediate questions. First, to what extent are Hispanic households underrepresented in housing and homelessness programs across the country? Second, why is this the case? This article begins with a national analysis of Hispanic representation in federal housing subsidy programs and homeless shelter services at the county level. The authors test the relationship between a high degree of underrepresentation and county characteristics. The second part of the article presents a case study of Philadelphia using local program data, focus groups with residents, and direct interviews with 10 stakeholders to explore Hispanic Philadelphians housing experiences and barriers to participation in housing and homeless assistance programs. The data and methods employed in this article allow the authors to gain a better understanding of where and why low-income Hispanics do not access housing and homeless assistance and provide insight into how local and federal programs can be adjusted to better serve these growing needs.",

    "abstract": "This study tests a typology of family homelessness based on patterns of public shelter utilization and examines whether family characteristics are associated with those patterns. The results indicate that a substantial majority of homeless families stay in public shelters for relatively brief periods, exit, and do not return. Approximately 20 percent stay for long periods. A small but noteworthy proportion cycles in and out of shelters repeatedly. In general, families with long stays are no more likely than families with short stays to have intensive behavioral health treatment histories, to be disabled, or to be unemployed. Families with repeat stays have the highest rates of intensive behavioral health treatment, placement of children in foster care, disability, and unemployment. The results suggest that policy and program factors, rather than family characteristics, are responsible for long shelter stays. An alternative conceptual framework for providing emergency assistance to homeless families is discussed.",

States continue to be the largest payor for public substance abuse services, accounting for 47% of the total, with the federal government increasing its proportionate share 8%. Interstate variability in per capita expenditures on public substance abuse services is considerable, primarily due to variations in revenues provided by state governments. Future research is needed to determine the sources and effects of differences in states' relative commitments to substance abuse services.",

With the 2009 AHAR, we now have three complete years of data on the numbers and characteristics of sheltered homeless people, how they became homeless, and how they used the homeless services system. This is important, because we can begin to see discernable trends in homelessness, including the effects of the recession and of changes over time to the homeless services system. The 2009 AHAR also marks continued improvement in both sources of estimates of homelessness used in the reports. A larger number of communities are reporting Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data to the AHAR, which is used in the analysis of patterns of homelessness over a years time. In 2009, 334 communitiesrepresenting 2,988 counties and 1,056 citiesreported usable HMIS data to the report, a sizable increase from last years report (222 communities). At the same time, the point-in-time (PIT) counts essential for estimating the numbers and characteristics of all homeless people, both sheltered and unsheltered, are improving as communities use more rigorous methodologies for conducting the counts. For the first time, this 2009 AHAR includes information from in-person interviews with local service providers located in nine communities nationwide. This qualitative information provides a contextual backdrop for understanding how homelessness is changing.",

A majority (68%) was staying in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, or safe havens, and 32 percent were in unsheltered locations. Over one-fifth of people experiencing homelessness were children (22%), 69 percentwere over the age of 24, and nine percent were between the ages of 18 and 24. Between 2015 and 2016, the number of people experiencing homelessness declined by three percent. Declines were composed entirely ofpeople staying in sheltered locations (which declined by 5%). Homelessness increased among people staying in unsheltered locations (by 2%).",

The HMIS estimates provide information on demographics and patterns of shelter use of people who use the nations emergency shelters, safe havens, and transitional housing programs. The report also provides demographic information about people who transitioned from homelessnesseither sheltered or unshelteredto permanent supportive housing (PSH) and rapid rehousing (RRH) during this same one-year period.Key Findings: In 2018, an estimated 1,446,000 people in the U.S. experienced sheltered homelessness at some point during the year. Nearly two-thirds were in households with only adults. Thirty-five percent of people who experienced homelessness were in families with children. A small share (only one percent) were in child-only households. Black or African American people were considerably overrepresented among people experiencing homelessness. While representing 13 percent of all U.S. heads of households and 22 percent of heads of households living in poverty, people identifying as black accounted for 43 percent of heads of shelteredhouseholds in 2018. Nearly one in five heads of households and other adults using shelters had a chronic pattern of homelessness (18%). One in every ten sheltered adults was a veteran.",

Preventing and ending homelessness requires accurate information on the size and nature of the homelessness in the country, both at a point-in-time and on an annual basis. This report provides information onthe one-year estimates of people who were able to access shelter programs in both 2019 and 2020. Following the implementation of a new platform for collecting data from communities, 2019 has now become the baseline year for tracking changes in the numbers and characteristics of people who use shelter programs at some timeduring a year.The COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in March 2020, affecting six months of the 2020 reporting year. Data presented in this report reflect the considerable disruptions to the homeless service system during this time. Some shelters were closed, and many others reduced the number of beds available for occupancy.Data presented in this report show that the total number of people using shelters declined between 2019 and 2020. This decline likely reflects reduced shelter capacity in some communities, as well as peoples reluctance to enter shelters because of health and safety concerns.",

    "abstract": "The number of people officially enumerated as living on the streets in Japan has been consistently decreasing since 2003. As of January 2020, there were 3 992 unsheltered people counted on a single night, which is about16% of the peak in 2003. In contrast, in the US 226 080 people were counted as unsheltered on a single night in 2020 and this number has been consistently increasing since 2015. This paper will focus on one cause of this difference, the respective public assistance systems in the US and Japan. The main public assistance system in Japan, Seikatsu-Hogo (Livelihood Protection) is argued to be a major factor driving the decline in the number of people living unsheltered there. But the characteristics of the Livelihood Protection programme that have contributed to this decline in street homelessness have not been examined in detail. We argue that three characteristics of Japans public assistance programme are at the core of its success in addressing street homelessness 1) generality, 2) comprehensiveness, and 3) expeditiousness. We also provide an overview of some important shortcomings of the programme. Clarifying how Japan has been able to reduce street homelessness provides insights for measures to address street homelessness in the US and other countries.",

The evaluation used the Rapid Assessment, Response, and Evaluation method to collect qualitative findings on service use barriers and facilitators from open-ended interviews with people staying in the encampments (N = 27) and service providers (N = 1 0). We assessed how the ERP allowed providers to \"push the system\" by removing access barriers, and providing amenable, effective, and accessible housing and drug treatment services that led to more widely adopted best practices. However, there was a clear need for additional supportive services and aftercare for those exiting treatment. Providers also cited a need for more integrated medical and mental health services.",

    "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Administrative databases from the City of Philadelphia that track public shelter utilisation (n=44 337) and AIDS case reporting (n=7749) were merged to identify rates and risk factors for co-occurring homelessness and AIDS. DESIGN: Multiple decrement life tables analyses were conducted, and logistic regression analyses used to identify risk factors associated with AIDS among the homeless, and homelessness among people with AIDS. SETTING: City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. MAIN RESULTS: People admitted to public shelters had a three year rate of subsequent AIDS diagnosis of 1.8 per 100 person years; nine times the rate for the general population of Philadelphia. Logistic regression results show that substance abuse history (OR = 3.14), male gender (OR = 2.05), and a history of serious mental disorder (OR = 1.62) were significantly related to the risk for AIDS diagnosis among shelter users. Among people with AIDS, results show a three year rate of subsequent shelter admission of 6.9 per 100 person years, and a three year rate of prior shelter admission of 9%, three times the three year rate of shelter admission for the general population. Logistic regression results show that intravenous drug user history (OR = 3.14); no private insurance (OR = 2.93); black race (OR = 2.82); pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB (OR = 1.43); and pneumocystis pneumonia (OR = 0.56) were all related to the risk for shelter admission. CONCLUSIONS: Homelessness prevention programmes should target people with HIV risk factors, and HIV prevention programmes should be targeted to homeless persons, as these populations have significant intersection. Reasons and implications for this intersection are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses how researchers and others have analyzed the services histories of persons who have experienced homelessness, as well as their imputed costs. This research has been used both to make visible the ways in which the clients of mainstream social welfare systems (health, corrections, income maintenance and child welfare) become homeless and, complementarily, the impact of people who experience homelessness on the use of these service systems. Most published work in this area has been based on the integration of administrative databases to identify cases and service utilization patterns; some have used retrospective interviews. Results have been used to encourage agency administrators and policymakers to make investments in programs that reduce homelessness and/or the duration of homelessness periods. Quite recently, many local homeless services planning organizations in the US have used this approach to demonstrate the high costs of chronic homelessness and the potential cost offsets associated with the placement of people in supported housing. The opportunities and limitations associated with these various approaches, including their potential applicability to other countries and service sectors are discussed.",

Considering adults in households with children, those who experienced higher levels of childhood adversity were more likely to have experienced homelessness in adulthood. Meanwhile, a 10-factor index of cumulative developmental risk was independently associated with childhood adversity and with adult homelessness. Adult homelessness appears to represent a circumstance through which past childhood adversities are brought forward and associated with contexts of developmental risk for subsequent generations of children.",

Use of data from the Inventory of Mental Health Organizations (NIMH, 1983, 1986), revelaed that not-for-profits provide more services and serve more of the underinsured, while for-profits serve the better insured, concentrate primarily on inpatient services, and serve more children, adolescents, and substance abusers. A surplus bed capacity among for-profit psychiatric hospitals is presumed to contribute to lower occupancy rates and less turnover in the for-profit sector. Not-for-profit psychiatric facilities are also found to be more involved in professional training and to be more accessible through emergency services. However, the misclassification test in the discriminant procedure reveals that a significant group of not-for-profit facilities looks more like its for-profit counterpart group than like other not-for-profits. Study findings are interpreted both in terms of debates over the tax-exempt status of not-for-profit hospitals and the potential negative services effects of proprietization.",

The outcome was shelter entry documented in administrative data within 6 months following the baseline ED visit. Exposures were responses to questions on homelessness risk factors from baseline questionnaires.Data collection/extraction methods: Research assistants completed questionnaires with randomly sampled ED patients who were medically stable, not in police/prison custody, and spoke English or Spanish. Questionnaires were linked to administrative data using deterministic and probabilistic matching.Principal findings: Of 1993 ED patients who were not homeless at baseline, 5.6% entered a shelter in the next 6 months. A screening tool consisting of two measures of past shelter use and one of past criminal justice involvement had 83.0% sensitivity and 20.4% positive predictive value for future shelter entry.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential of using cross-sector data to improve hospital initiatives to address patients' social needs.",

Compared with known users, nonusers and occasional users were less likely to have had a severe mental illness diagnosis or to have received either disability benefits or Medicaid coverage and were more likely to be white. Nonusers and occasional users were also more likely than known users to have died in outlying parts of the city.Conclusions: More conventional homeless surveys and enumerations miss a substantial portion of the homelesspopulation. Including these hidden homeless persons would alter perceptions about the composition of Philadelphias homeless population, lowering estimates of the incidence of psychiatric disability and increasing estimates of racial diversity.",

    "abstract": "Amidst concern about the implications of an aging U.S. population, recent evidence suggests that there is a unique aging trend among the homeless population. Building on this, we use data from New York City and from the last three decennial Census enumerations to assess how the age composition of the homeless populationboth single adults and adults in familieshas changed over time. Findings show diverging trends in aging patterns for single adults and adults in families over the past 20 years. Among single adults, the bulk of the sheltered population is comprised of persons born during the latter part of the baby boom era whose high risk for homelessness has continued as they have aged. Specifically, the age group in this population facing the highest risk for homelessness was 3436 (born 19541956) in 1990; 3742 (born 19581963) in 2000; and 4951 (born 19591961) in 2010. In contrast, among adults in sheltered families, there is no indication of any progressive aging of the family household heads. The modal age across the study period remains at 2123 years of age. We consider implications for the health care and social welfare systems, and policy responses to homelessness.",

On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International concern and on February 11, 2020 the WHO announced the name of the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19 (WHO, 2020). By mid-March, starting with California, in almost every state in the United States, persons were encouraged to shelter in place and to practice social distancing to flatten the growth curve of infection to allow hospitals and emergency health care resources to adequately keep pace with those experiencing acute medical crises (Baral et al., 2020). Asking citizens to shelter in place and practice social distancing created an unprecedented urgency for communities across the country to respond to the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in the face of this crisis (Doran et al., 2020; Lima et al., 2020; Tsai & Wilson, 2020).Primary concerns that quickly emerged across the nation were: How to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness who become infected with COVID-19 How to provide adequate shelter to prevent COVID-19 infection among medically vulnerable persons experiencing homelessness (over 65, underlying health conditions) How to address shelter density in existing congregate shelters to comply with CDC guidance for social distancing in shelters (110 sq ft per person) How to address the health and safety of unsheltered persons including people in encampments, in light of the crisis; How to protect staff who serve persons experiencing homelessness How to acquire financial resources and PPE supplies to address the needs of people who are homeless How to coordinate screening, testing, tracking and contact tracing with community partners. The responses to this survey provide an understanding of how communities through their CoCs have responded to COVID-19 in the first 4-6 weeks of the crisis.",

    "abstract": "The nation is now ten months into a national emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For homeless services systems, it has impacted temporary housing offerings, staffing, resources, and countless other areas. To understand these changes, the Alliance initiated the Voices from the Field project, which has included three national surveys, a series of interviews, and data collection from a small sampling of Continuums of Care (CoCs). The current report highlights the most recent survey (conducted in November) and some insights from the data collection efforts.The findings point to systems that quickly set up motel/hotel programs, most of which are still up and running as of November. Although survey respondents report expanding the availability of permanent housing, they also estimate that most clients leaving these quarantine/isolation rooms return to shelters and unsheltered locations. Frustration with this norm is causing CoC representatives to identify permanent housing as their number one priority for any new resources that become available. Other significant needs include staffing and growing existing motel/hotel efforts. If CoCs are unable to fund such items, they predict tragic consequences such as growth in unsheltered homelessness.",

In difficult times such as these, the most vulnerable people tend to endure the most significant hardships while being left behind on the road to recovery. Local homeless services providers play a crucial role in reducing the harm. Thus, the Alliance is tracking their progress in responding to the current moment.Alliance staff and research partners conducted an online survey of Continuum of Care (CoC) leaders in April, publishing the results in Community-level Responses of Homelessness Assistance Programs to COVID-19: Data from May 2020 and a supplementary policy brief. Alliance staff and researchers further explored the issues raised within a series of interviews. Responding to COVID-19: Conversations with Homeless System Leaders summarizes our discussions with a subset of survey respondents. Altogether, the findings suggested systems were overwhelmed by new responsibilities, a lack of available supplies, staffing shortages, and severe financial limitations.The current report reflects the findings of a second online survey of CoC leaders, and notes note progress in areas such as access to personal protective equipment (PPE), screening, and testing. However, there continue to be challenges as systems simultaneously juggle the pressures to 1) respond to public health needs, 2) maintain system functioning, and 3) continue to make progress on the goal of reducing homelessness.",

Results show that inpatient and foster care services use drops in the homelessness period, but rebounds following exit, regardless of pattern of shelter use, and type of housing exit. Results suggest that shelters supplant use of services, but not on a sustained basis. Despite declines in concurrent services use, the homelessness period is overall more costly for episodically and long-term shelter users, primarily owing to the high costs of shelter. High rates of inpatient and foster care services use following the homeless spell suggest that providers of homeless assistance should systematically screen and refer homeless families to on-going community-based service supports. Service use patterns indicate that homeless spells may disrupt continuity of care with community-based health and social services.",

Low-income, Black, and Latinx residents are more likely to be rent-burdened and pay more money toward their utility bills than their counterparts. They are also more likely to experience utility insecurity. Areas with higher concentrations of minority residents have much higher rates of utility arrears and disconnections as well as much higher rates of enrollment in utility assistance programs. In addition, roughly three-quarters of Black and Latinx survey respondents reported falling behind on rent or mortgage paymentssince March, and one-third of Black residents reported being either formally or informally evicted and were the most likely to worry about future evictions and utility shutoffs. We also found that communities with higher non-white shares of the population were hit hardest by the coronavirus, especially in the early months. The relationship between virus prevalence and race became less pronounced as the virus became more ubiquitous through the fall and winter.",

Most reforms have focused on reducing the capacity of the shelter system by reducing the average length of stay of persons in shelter and by providing housing relocation assistance. However, these reforms have been compromised by an inability to contol the demand for shelter, particularly the rate of new admissions , and by the extent of need for housing assistance among homeless and near-homeless people in Philadelphia. Alternative methods of financing shelters are described, as are attempts to create a system of specialty shelter providers.

Two cohorts of young adults from both systems were selected for analysis. Within the two cohorts, this study focuses on three groups of youth exiters: (i) The child welfare (CW) group is comprised of youth who exited from a child welfare out-of-home placement between the ages of 16 and 21; (ii) the juvenile probation (JP) group is made up of youth who exited from any type of juvenile probation supervision between the ages of 16 and 21; and (iii) the crossover group is comprised of all youth who exited an out-of-home child welfare placement between the ages of 16 and 21 and who also had a record of nvolvement with the juvenile probation system. The adult outcomes of youth in each of these three groups are analyzed by linking their administrative records from Los Angeles Countys Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and/or Probation Department with administrative databases from seven County departments providing an array of public services to residents of Los Angeles County, as well as from two California statewide agencies. Results indicate high levels of correctional system and public assistance involvement across the study groups, with particularly high rates of utilization among crossover youth. Patterns of health and behavioral health services use follow a similar pattern. Imputed costs by group and by service sector are reported. Educational attainment and reported income are also documented. Regression analyses examine independent predictors of various outcomes by study group.",

Lastly, we consider recent efforts to address homelessness through improved evidence-based practices, in both a national and local context, and consider how these efforts could better assist Latinx adults and families facing imminent homelessness in resolving or avoiding homelessness in the near future.",

If the 86 people had been homeless for one year with the same pattern of service use, estimated public spending would be 34,518 on average per person per year, a total of some 2.96 million annually. For a single homeless population of 40,000, if estimated costs were at the average level, annual public expenditure would be some 1.38 billion.This report also uses the available data to estimate the changes in service use that would occur, if someone were not homeless - because their homelessness was prevented - compared to the costs that arose because they were homeless. On average, it was estimated that preventing homelessness for one year would result in a reduction in public expenditure of 9,266 per person.

Identifiers and service records from longitudinal databases on shelter and mental health services were merged, finding that 49% of single homeless adults and 33.2% of homeless adults with children had a treatment for a mental health or substance use disorder between 1985 and 1993. The rate of treatment for serious mental illness (SMI) was 10.7% (by most frequently occurring diagnosis). Single women (18.6%) had twice the rate of SMI as single men (9.9%), and single adults (12.1%) had twice the rate of SMI as adults with children (6.2%). The treate rate of substance use disorders (25.2%) was higher than the rate of mental health disorders (20%), and was twice as high for single adults (28.6%) as for adults with children (14.6%). An additional 20% of adult shelter users were identified through shelter records as having untreated substance use problems. Veterans had comparable rates of disorders as nonveterans. Oveall, 65% of adult shelter users were identified as ever having some mental health or substance use problem, treated or untreated. People with SMI were less represented among shelter users on two single day censuses than over three years, suggesting a higher rate of turnover among people with SMI, while people with substance use disorders were overrepresented by a third on the two single day censuses, suggesting a lower rate of turnover among people treated for sugbstance abuse. Of the treated Medicaid population, 6.8% became homeless in the three year study period, representing 7.8% of the treated population with SMI, 9.5% of the treated schizophrenia population, and 20.1% of the population receiving inpatient substance abuse services. Approximately 3,000 people with SMI became homeless in the 3-year study period, with an average of 73 people with SMI entering shelter for the first time each month. An analysis of inpatient usage found that 25.7% of the SMI and 34.2% of the treated substance abuse population were hospitalized within 120 days of their first shelter admission (before or after). Fourteen percent of the SMI were also seen in an emergency room within 120 days of shelter admission (before or after).",

    "abstract": "A group of international researchers with experience of strategic analysis of homelessness policy, practice and service programmes were asked to review the effects of the Rebuilding Ireland strategy on the level and nature of Irish homelessness. The review took the stance of a critical friend, drawing on possible lessons from practice elsewhere in Europe and in North America.The review included discussions and consultations with stakeholders in the design and delivery of homelessness policy and services and with people with lived experience of homelessness, who were asked about the issues they thought were most important in reducing homelessness in Ireland. Irish views on strengths and limitations were identified through these discussions, which were then used to structure the wider analysis in this review, drawing on possibly beneficial practice from other countries and avoiding some of the problems other countries had encountered. The review did not consider the specific questions arising around migrant groups who are ineligible to join housing lists.Homelessness was seen as being defined in a relatively narrow way, i.e. focusing on people sleeping rough and the number and duration of stays in emergency accommodation. This was seen as neglecting hidden homelessness and by extension, not fully recognising and not fully responding to the true nature of homelessness in Ireland. While some measures had fallen, experience of homelessness remained more common than had been the case. Existing measures were also thought to highlight urban homelessness.Womens experience of homelessness tends to be significantly underestimated when enumeration does not include an attempt to count hidden homelessness. The most effective, integrated strategies, including practice in Scotland and Finland, use a wide definition of homelessness which facilitates a more comprehensive array of prevention, rapid rehousing and housing-led, Housing First and supported housing services and cross referral of a broadly defined at risk population across wider health, criminal justice and social protection systems.Affordable and social housing supply were thought to be at the core of homelessness causation and the limitations of existing policy in preventing and ending homelessness. Services like Housing First were hampered, as was any service within a housing-led framework as soon as adequate, affordable housing with reasonable security of tenure was in short supply. Progress was noted in addressing these issues, but more social and affordable housing was needed. People with lived experience of homelessness reported that only social housing offered the affordability, standards and security of tenure that enabled a sustained exit from homelessness.Internationally, no level of coordination, evidence-led practice or comprehensiveness of response has been found that counteracts the effects of insufficient affordable, adequate homes with security of tenure. Prevention, housing-led and Housing First services, alongside the integration of health, mental health, addiction, criminal justice and welfare systems in a homelessness strategy will either be limited, or fail, if there are not enough suitable homes with which to prevent and end homelessness.Progress has been made in homelessness prevention in Ireland, although with the caveat that the ongoing issues with inadequate housing supply limit overall effectiveness. There are lessons from comprehensive preventative systems used in other countries, such as that developed in Wales, which define and respond to homelessness on a broad basis and appear to reach much of the population who are at risk of homelessness.Housing First has become a significant part of the policy response to homelessness. Systems are at their most developed in Dublin and other urban areas, with reports of more uneven coverage in some more rural areas. Internationally, the key lesson appears to be that Housing First delivered through a coherent, comprehensive and well-resourced strategy achieves both better coverage and more consistent results. Something to avoid is the rather haphazard development of many small scale projects, which while they may show success, are not part of a coherent, properly resourced national plan, leading to inconsistencies in coverage and results, as seen in England, Italy and Sweden.The needs of women, which are distinct, in the sense that their homelessness is much more closely associated with domestic abuse (much family homelessness is women lone parents and dependent children at risk of domestic abuse) and they are more likely to avoid (often male dominated) services and use informal arrangements with family, friends or acquaintances (hidden homelessness). With some exceptions in terms of women-only, housing-led and Housing First services, much service provision is still built on an assumption that homelessness is mainly experienced by lone men. This is not specific to Ireland, greater recognition of womens needs and experiences and the extent of their homelessness is a pan-EU issue.North West European and North American countries tend to recognise young people, including care leavers (young adults who have been in care of social work/child protection services) as having specific needs when they experience homelessness, centring on their youth, adverse childhood experiences and associated vulnerability. This is an area that could be the subject of more detailed policy consideration in Ireland.Coordination of services and information about those services were reported as inconsistent and as in need of improvement by people with lived experience of homelessness. The standardisation of responses seen in strategies like that of Finland or the (distinct) legislative frameworks of Scotland and Wales may be useful in addressing this issue.The review has drawn together key lessons from international experience that may be of use as the new strategy Housing for All is implemented, these include:Recognising that a broader definition of homelessness can be the gateway to building a more comprehensive, effective strategic response.Prevention, housing-led and Housing First services are most effective when part of an integrated, interagency homelessness strategy because they depend on cross referral to an array of other services.Implementation must be comprehensive if a strategy is to work and this means that governance must be clear, focused and stable, ensuring that coherent strategy steadily builds in effectiveness over time.",

    "abstract": "Findings from Year 4 show that, for the third consecutive year, over 20,000 people experiencing homelessness exited homeless services to Permanent Housing (PH) placements (macro-measure 2). Nearly 10,000 of these PH placements occurred within the purview of HI-supported initiatives (meso-measure 3). Looking at these PH placements over the last three years, 56,000 unduplicated people exited shelter stays to PH (both HI- and non-HI-funded), and 31,000 of these exits came under the auspices of HI-supported services.Noteworthy also were Interim Housing (IH) placements, which declined 25% after significant year-over-year growth since FY 2016-17. Building IH capacity is a key component of reducing LAs large unsheltered population, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting need to decompress shelter facilities, has handed these efforts an additional challenge. The reduction in IH housing capacity in Year 4 is one of the first indicators of COVID-19s impact on LAs homeless services, and COVID-19 will almost certainly have a much larger impact on HI strategies in the upcoming Year 5. In addition, the rental unit vacancies in LA has been very low over the past couple of years making permanent housing opportunities harder to secure. This has made the IH lengths of stay longer, thus reducing the number of IH beds that turn over.",

    "abstract": "As has been the practice in all four previous HI annual performance evaluations, the main body of this report begins at a macro level of measurement in Section 2, where the performance of Measure Hfunded HI strategies and services unaffiliated with the HI strategies are examined together to offer a systemwide perspective. The analysis then moves down to the program or meso-level in Section 3, separately exploring HI strategy outcomes aggregated into broader categories, the three most important of which are permanent housing (PH), interim housing (IH), and prevention. This separate analysis of the HI strategies as a collective program enables their performance to be gauged against comparable non-HI service categories while also establishing a basis for measuring the HIs contribution to systemwide performance. Appendix A provides the performance measurements at the level of individual strategies. In addition, Section 4 provides an assessment of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authoritys (LAHSAs) recent Point-in-Time (PIT) homeless counts informed by a homeless services systems through-flow analysis, and Section 5 provides a pre/post evaluation of health, mental health and jail outcomes for households placed by HI.",

Representing the ongoing and coordinated commitment between HUD and the VA to end and prevent homelessness among those who have served in our nations military, this Veteran Supplemental Report provides both 1-day and 1-year estimates of the number of homeless veterans in the United States. In addition to the snapshot and annual estimates, this report describes the demographic characteristics of homeless veterans, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, and disability status. These characteristics are compared to those of other populations including the non-veteran homeless population, the total veteran population, and the population of veterans living in poverty. These comparisons highlight the higher risks of homelessness faced by veterans, particularly poor veterans. Also discussed in this report are the locations of homeless veterans across the country as well as how they access and use the homeless residential system. Finally, annual comparisons of estimates are made to suggest how homelessness among veterans is changing over time.",

We used prior address information reported by families entering emergency shelters in two large U.S. cities to characterize the nature of that distribution.Three dense clusters of homeless origins were found in Philadelphia and three in New York City, accounting for 67 percent and 61 percent of shelter admissions and revealing that homeless families prior addresses are more highly concentrated than the poverty distribution in both cities. The rate of shelter admission is strongly and positively related to the concentration of poor, African-American, and female-headed households with young children in a neighborhood. It is also correlated with fewer youth, elderly, and immigrants. Such areas have higher rates of unemployment and labor force nonparticipation, more housing crowding, more abandonment, higher rates of vacancy, and higher rent-to-income ratios than other areas.",

    "abstract": "Equity assessments, like those described in this working paper, have historical roots in the Civil Rights movement. As part of demands for equitable access to jobs, resources, and services, communities of color and Civil Rights advocates pressed public and private institutions to document the representation of racial and ethnic groups (National Archives, 2016). Corrective action plans were used to develop clear strategies to redress inequities and hold institutions accountable to change. Affirmative action policies reinforced these strategies by requiring certain groups, such as federal contractors, to develop numerical targets and timelines to correct for underutilization of services by marginalized groups (Legal Information Institute, n.d.).Human service agencies are now being called upon once again to address inequities within their programs. In January 2021, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, which requires federal agencies to identify methods for assessing equity within federal programs and to engage communities historically underserved or discriminated against in these programs (Exec. Order No. 13985, 2021). This working paper strives to build upon the aims of the Civil Rights movement to help human service agencies estimate and respond to racial and ethnic inequities in their service provision. The urgency of this work is underscored not only by the executive order, but also by the long overdue social unrest around racialized violence and inequity in the U.S. and the stark racial disparities in experience and outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic.The following sections of this paper outline three phases of workperforming a gaps analysis (measuring gaps between need for and current availability of services), interpreting the gaps analysis (assessing root causes of the problem and strategizing responses), and co-creating an equity plan (determining next steps and implementing strategies to correct for inequities). Importantly, community organizations and those with lived experiences of the systems under consideration need to be engaged throughout this entire process. See AToolkit for Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration for more (Hawn Nelson et al., 2020a). In addition, the general process provided here will need to be customized based on the social issue of interest, local context, available data, and resource constraints. Drawing upon multiple data sources, types of expertise, and stakeholder perspectives is highly recommended in order to robustly assess and respond to inequities in service provision. Altogether, these methods can inform social policymaking and support human serviceagencies in more equitable resource allocation and service provision.",

    "abstract": "The economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened demand for cross-agency data capacity, as policymakers are forced to reconcile the need for expanded services with extreme fiscal constraints. In this context, integrated data systems (IDS) also commonly referred to as data hubs, data collaboratives, or state longitudinal data systems are a valuable resource for data-informed decision making across agencies. IDS utilize standard governance processes and legal agreements to grant authority for routine, responsible use of linked data, and institutionalize roles across partners with shared priorities. Despite these benefits, creating and sustaining IDS remains a challenge for many states. Legislation and executive action can be powerful mechanisms to overcome this challenge and promote the use of cross-agency data for public good.This brief is organized in three parts. First, we offer examples of approaches from states that have used legislation and/or executive orders to enable data integration, as well as key considerations related to each. Second, we discuss state and federal funding opportunities that can help in implementing legislative or executive actions on data sharing and enhancing long-term sustainability of data sharing efforts. Third, we offer five foundational strategies to ensure that legislative or executive action is both ethical and effective.",

    "abstract": "This report examines health services use and population dynamics among the aging homeless population in Los Angeles. Evidence suggests that adverse health outcomes lead to homelessness, and the conditions related to homelessness lead to or exacerbate a range of health problems (Hwang, 2001). In addition, the barriers to accessing preventative and primary care while homeless lead to receipt of healthcare only when morbidities are more acute, (Reid, Vittinghoff, & Kushel, 2008; Kushel, Gupta, Gee, & Haas, 2006; Lim, Andersen, Leake, Cunningham, & Gelberg, 2002) meaning that there is a disproportionate use of inpatient hospitalization and other costly medical and behavioral health services among persons experiencing homelessness (Doran et al., 2013; Hwang, Weaver, Aubry, & Hoch, 2011; Kushel, Perry, Bangsberg, Clark, & Moss, 2002; Salit, Kuhm & Hartz, 1998). As a result, homelessness is expensive for healthcare systems and for society as a whole (Latimer et al., 2017; Flaming, Burns, & Matsunaga, 2009; Culhane, 2008). Given this, interest in using healthcare systems as a platform to address homelessness has grown in recent years. Strategies include efforts to identify homelesspatients in healthcare settings in order to link them with housing and social services (Garg, Toy, Tripodis,Silverstein, & Freeman, 2015; Gottlieb, Hessler, Long, Amaya, & Adler, 2014); the creation of accountable care organizations that seek to coordinate healthcare and social services for persons experiencing housing instability (Mahadevan & Houston, 2015); and the development of new financing mechanisms geared towards using healthcare dollars to support housing stability (Burt, Wilkins, & Locke, 2014).",

In addition, the barriers to accessing preventative and primary care while homeless lead to receipt of healthcare only when morbidities are more acute, (Reid, Vittinghoff, & Kushel, 2008; Kushel, Gupta, Gee, & Haas, 2006; Lim, Andersen, Leake, Cunningham, & Gelberg, 2002) meaning that there is a disproportionate use of inpatient hospitalization and other costly medical and behavioral health services among persons experiencing homelessness (Doran et al., 2013; Hwang, Weaver, Aubry, & Hoch, 2011; Kushel, Perry, Bangsberg, Clark, & Moss, 2002; Salit, Kuhm & Hartz, 1998). As a result, homelessness is expensive for healthcare systems and for society as a whole (Latimer et al., 2017; Flaming, Burns, & Matsunaga, 2009; Culhane, 2008). Given this, interest in using healthcare systems as a platform to address homelessness has grown in recent years. Strategies include efforts to identify homelesspatients in healthcare settings in order to link them with housing and social services (Garg, Toy, Tripodis,Silverstein, & Freeman, 2015; Gottlieb, Hessler, Long, Amaya, & Adler, 2014); the creation of accountable care organizations that seek to coordinate healthcare and social services for persons experiencing housing instability (Mahadevan & Houston, 2015); and the development of new financing mechanisms geared towards using healthcare dollars to support housing stability (Burt, Wilkins, & Locke, 2014).",

    "abstract": "While in the US a large volume of quantitative impact studies on homelessness has been generated over many years, homelessness researchers in the UK have tended to be concerned, at least until recently, with more qualitative and conceptual forms of exploration and evaluation. This contrast between the US and UK extant homelessness literatures can be traced back to the different research traditions that have emerged over the years on opposite sides of the Atlantic (Fitzpatrick and Christian, 2006). In the UK, applied housing studies specialists have tended to dominate academic research on homelessness, with the important role played by domestic legislation in tackling homelessness in the UK also meaning that there is a strong tradition of socio-legal scholarship in this field (Cowan, 2019). More theoretical contributions in the UK, as in the US, often emerge from urban geography or sociology perspectives (Lancione, 2013), although a sharply contrasting conceptual approach within the UK now sees mainstream moral philosophy applied to the ethical challenges and dilemmas that abound in homelessness policy and practice (Watts et al, 2017). Health-orientated research on homelessness has generally been relatively marginal to the policy debate in the UK, not least because it is often very narrowly focused (for example on oral health or blood-borne viruses among specific homeless subpopulations). That said, there is now increasing engagement from UK-based public health specialists in the complex needs of homeless people who face compounding problems of substance misuse, mental ill-health and/or involvement in the criminal justice system (Aldridge et al, 2018; Luchenski et al, 2018). In the US, by contrast, psychological, sociological and medical perspectives have long played a central role in homelessness research, along with significant contributions from social policy and economics scholars. The prominence of these clinical perspectives, and a more quantitative approach in the social sciences more generally, has engendered a research tradition heavily slanted toward statistical research and policy and programme evaluation. Here we explore the UK and US traditions with a view to identifying how new opportunities presented by developments in the field might help forge a path to better homelessness research and, more importantly, better homelessness responses.",

The implementation framework provided here builds on a March 24, 2020 report prepared by the CEOs Office of Homeless Initiative (HI), which provides the basic contours for an Older Adult Housing Pilot that would seek to permanently house all willing homeless adults who are at least 65 years of age. The HIs report, however, represents deliberations and the realities of Los Angeles Countys homeless services system prior to the onset of the coronavirus public health emergency. The implications of the pandemic have unfolded contemporaneously with the development of a pilot implementation approach and created some challenges for the pilot planning process during the past six months, particularly in terms of questions about pilot funding sources. While some details have gradually come into sharper focus over this period, a number of key issues remain unresolved at the present time, and the availability of some previously assumed funding sources has been deferred until Year Two of the pilot, at the earliest.Within this fluid context, the plan we offer in this report - the projected population for which is shown in Figure 1, along with the costs associated with serving these clients - represents a necessary modification of our initial plan but also reflects the persistence of a basic tension: While COVID-19 temporarily, but indefinitely, places restrictions on the use of previously-available resources, older adult homelessness is a growing and increasingly expensive problem, one likely to worsen in the absence of a systematic and coordinated intervention. More immediately, the heightened risk of complications and fatality for older adults who become infected with the coronavirus adds to the urgency of moving homeless older adults from the streets to the safety of permanent housing.",

It requires intergovernmental coordination and collaboration among bureaucracies. It is what is needed to inform disciplined, evidence-based decision making. We developed the AISP model to address the major limitations to traditional approaches to American public administration identified in the literature.Actionable Intelligence is a robust integrated data system (IDS)IDS integrates individual citizens data across agencies to provide scientifically sound, intergovernmental information to inform AIAI can provide a comprehensive picture of the whole person and has the potential of bringing everyone from health, education, and humans service agencies together around one tableThrough the use of an IDS, data-sharing agencies can contribute their clients data to one collaborative process to achieve a more thorough understanding of a pressing social problem and what to do about it",
