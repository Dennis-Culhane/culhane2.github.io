We calculated the baseline annual frequency of homelessness and risk among all veterans who completed an initial screen during the studyperiod. We measured changes in housing status among veterans who initiallyscreened positive and then completed a follow-up screen, assessed factorsassociated with such changes, and identified distinct risk profiles of veteranswho completed a follow-up screen.\r\n\r\nResults. More than 4 million veterans completed an initial screen; 1.8% (nÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ®ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ77,621) screened positive for homelessness or risk. Of those who initially screened positive for either homelessness or risk and who completed a second\r\nscreen during the study period, 85.0% (nÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ®ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ15,060) resolved their housing instability prior to their second screen. Age, sex, race, VHA eligibility, and screeninglocation were all associated with changes in housing stability. We identifiedfour distinct risk profiles for veterans with ongoing housing instability.\r\n\r\nConclusion. To address homelessness among veterans, efforts should include increased and targeted engagement of veterans experiencing persistent housing instability.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study is the first to examine the distribution of service utilization and costs with a population-based sample that experienced chronic homelessness in sheltered and unsheltered locations in a large U.S. city. Methods: This study used shelter and street outreach records from a large U.S. city to identify 2,703 persons who met federal criteria for chronic homelessness during a three-year period. Identifiers for these persons were matched to administrative records for psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, and incarceration. Results: Twenty percent of the persons who incurred the highest costs for services ccounted for 60% of the total service costs of approximately $20 million a year (or approximately $12 million). Most of the costs for this quintile were for psychiatric care and jail stays. Eighty-one percent of the persons in the highest quintile had a diagnosis of a serious mental illness, and 83% of the persons in the lowest quintile had a history of substance abuse treatment without a diagnosis of a serious mental illness. Conclusions: Supportive housing models for people with serious mental illness who experience chronic homelessness may be associated with substantial cost offsets, because the use of acute care services diminishes in an environment of housing stability and access to ongoing support services. However, because persons with substance use issues and no recent history of mental health treatment used relatively fewer and less costly services, cost neutrality for these persons may require less service-intensive programs and smaller subsidies.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the world, homelessness is recognised as a grand challenge (Padgett et al., 2016). As such, innovations in policy and practice are required to address that challenge. To that end, social investment from both the public and philanthropic sectors have been activated to test innovative new approaches to ending homelessness. These approaches span the development of new programmes, creations of new networks, and reorganising efforts from the public sector. In this study we will review three innovations (Social Impact Bonds, Collective Impact Networks,\r\nand New Approaches to Address Equity) that have been funded to end homelessness and will provide an assessment of the progress to date.",

    "abstract": "Objective:\r\n\r\nThis study examined the temporal sequencing of a first-recorded episode of homelessness and treatment for suicidal ideation or attempt.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nData were from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse and contained medical records of service use dates and associated ICD codes for care provided by the Veterans Health Administration. The analysis examined treatment for suicidality before and after a first record of homelessness (Ã¢ÂÂonsetÃ¢ÂÂ) among 152,519 veterans. The second analysis examined the rate of treatment for suicidality among 156,288 veterans with any indication of homelessness. The third analysis examined the rate of homelessness among 145,770 veterans with indication of suicidality.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nAmong newly homeless veterans, treatment for suicidality peaked just before onset of homelessness. Thirteen percent of homeless veterans had evidence of suicidality. Twenty-nine percent of veterans with evidence of suicidality appeared to have concurrent homelessness.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\n\r\nHomelessness should be considered a primary risk factor for suicidality.",

Persons considered chronically homeless by the proposed new definition and, to a lesser extent, by the twoalternative definitions,made heavier use of shelter comparedwith persons whomet the current definition.\r\nConclusions: A proposed new and two alternative definitions of chronic homelessness are better suited than the existing federal definition for identifying persons with the most protracted experiences of homelessness.",
