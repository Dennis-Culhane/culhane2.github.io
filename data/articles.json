    "abstract": "Previous studies that quantify the relationship between homeless rates and features of a community typically assume a global linear relationship. This linear model assumption precludes the possibility of inflection points in homeless rates - thresholds in quantifiable metrics of a community which, once breached, are associated with large increases in homelessness. In this paper, we identifying points of structural change in the relationship between homeless rates and community-level measures of housing affordability and extreme poverty. We develop a Dirichlet process mixture model that allows clusters of communities with similar features to exhibit common patterns of variation in homeless rates. A main finding of the study is that the expected homeless rate in a community increases sharply once median rental costs exceed 32% of median income, providing empirical evidence for the widely used definition of a housing cost burden at 30% of income. The Dirichlet process model also generates clusters that share common characteristics and exhibit distinct geographic patterns - yielding insight into the homelessness and housing affordability crises in large metropolitan areas on both coasts of the United States.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. This study compares the use of and cost for behavioral health services among heads of homeless and housed poor families. Methods. Medicaid records for 59,135 heads of families receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families benefits were matched with data from Philadelphiaâ€™s municipal shelter system. Propensity score matching was used to select a matched control group to those identified as having been homeless between 1997 and 2003. Behavioral health services utilization was then assessed based on Medicaid claims records. Results. Substantially higher levels of behavioral health services use and corresponding costs were found among heads of families with a history of shelter use. Conclusions. Greater use of behavioral health services by heads of homeless families may reflect greater severity of disorders or a greater likelihood to seek treatment relative to what has been suggested by previous research.",
