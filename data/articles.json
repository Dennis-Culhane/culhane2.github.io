    "abstract": "This article assesses the extent and predictors of homelessness among veterans (both veterans in families with children and single adults veterans) exiting the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, which is a nationwide homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing programgeared primarily toward those experiencing crisis homelessness.Among rapid re-housing participants, 16%and 26%of single adult veterans experienced an episode of homelessness at 1 and 2 years post-SSVF exit; the comparable figures at those follow-up times for veterans in familieswere 9.4%and 15.5%, respectively. Relatively fewer single adult veterans and veterans in families receiving homelessness prevention services experienced an episode of homelessness at 1 and 2 years post-SSVF exit. veteran-level characteristics, including age, gender, prior history of homelessness, and recent engagement with U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care, were generally more salient predictors of homelessness following SSVF exit than variables measuring SSVF program factors or community-level housing market conditions.",

    "abstract": "In April 2020, the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) conducted a national survey of local homeless assistance coordinating agencies, or Continuums of Care, to understand the impacts of COVID-19 and how communities have responded to this unprecedented public health crisis. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International concern and on February 11, 2020 the WHO announced the name of the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19 (WHO, 2020).

    "abstract": "Nearly all individuals experiencing chronic homelessness could be eligible for Medicaid in states pursuing Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Given that many of these individuals are at risk for high health care utilization and costs, state and federal policymakers and budget officials are increasingly interested in cost-effective approaches to meet the needs of this population. In July 2015, the Center for Health Care Strategies, with support from the California HealthCare Foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, and the New York State Health Foundation, convened state and federal officials along with research and policy experts to identify strategies for expanding access to housing and related services for Medicaid beneficiaries who are chronically homeless. This brief highlights key opportunities for Medicaid programs to better address the housing needs of this high-need, high-cost population.",

Univariate interrupted time-series analyses were conducted to determine if trends in shelter utilization (the number of families admitted, by family size, by race, by age of household head, by income, by disability indicator, and by average length of stay) changed significantly after March 1997, the month in which Act 35 was implemented, or after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of implementation. Results indicate that family size and household head age increased after the implementation of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, although not at consistent lags. A small negative effect on self-reported substance abuse and a small positive effect on the proportion of household heads with a disability were found, but at inconsistent lags.",

The purpose of this paper is threefold: First, it will present the conceptual framework for the IDS approach, describing how the IDS approach incorporates heuristic concepts from the major recent reform movements in public administration: performance management, continuous quality improvement, and evidence-based policymaking. Second, it will detail how these core features of the IDS approach are used to build a sustainable infrastructure to support a fully-functioning IDS for state and local government. Finally, the paper will illustrate how the IDS approach can be used as an effective and efficient vehicle to data-driven solutions through a close look at a single inquiry cycle and an overview of the larger systematic and iterative social problem-solving process within government.",

    "abstract": "The nation is now ten months into a national emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For homeless services systems, it has impacted temporary housing offerings, staffing, resources, and countless other areas. To understand these changes, the Alliance initiated the Voices from the Field project, which has included three national surveys, a series of interviews, and data collection from a small sampling of Continuums of Care (CoCs). The current report highlights the most recent survey (conducted in November) and some insights from the data collection efforts.\r\n\r\nThe findings point to systems that quickly set up motel/hotel programs, most of which are still up and running as of November. Although survey respondents report expanding the availability of permanent housing, they also estimate that most clients leaving these quarantine/isolation rooms return to shelters and unsheltered locations. Frustration with this norm is causing CoC representatives to identify permanent housing as their number one priority for any new resources that become available. Other significant needs include staffing and growing existing motel/hotel efforts. If CoCs are unable to fund such items, they predict tragic consequences such as growth in unsheltered homelessness.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of COVID-19 on American life have been widespread. Not only is the virus a public health crisis but it is complicating efforts to recover from the current recession. In difficult times such as these, the most vulnerable people tend to endure the most significant hardships while being left behind on the road to recovery. Local homeless services providers play a crucial role in reducing the harm. Thus, the Alliance is tracking their progress in responding to the current moment.\r\nAlliance staff and research partners conducted an online survey of Continuum of Care (CoC) leaders in April, publishing the results in Community-level Responses of Homelessness Assistance Programs to COVID-19: Data from May 2020 and a supplementary policy brief. Alliance staff and researchers further explored the issues raised within a series of interviews. Responding to COVID-19: Conversations with Homeless System Leaders summarizes our discussions with a subset of survey respondents. Altogether, the findings suggested systems were overwhelmed by new responsibilities, a lack of available supplies, staffing shortages, and severe financial limitations.\r\nThe current report reflects the findings of a second online survey of CoC leaders, and notes note progress in areas such as access to personal protective equipment (PPE), screening, and testing. However, there continue to be challenges as systems simultaneously juggle the pressures to 1) respond to public health needs, 2) maintain system functioning, and 3) continue to make progress on the goal of reducing homelessness.",

Results suggest that some multisystem services use is intentional, such as transfers from juvenile justice to mental health residential treatment, whereas other patterns reflect the complex and overlapping needs of youth moving among service sectors. Results may suggest areas of collaborative service planning and integrated service strategies, to improve outcomes and reduce costs and duplication of services.",

    "abstract": "This study examines families’ use of behavioral health hospitalization and foster care placement prior to, during and following shelter use, comparing families based on shelter pattern and type of housing exit. Results show that inpatient and foster care services use drops in the homelessness period, but rebounds following exit, regardless of pattern of shelter use, and type of housing exit. Results suggest that shelters supplant use of services, but not on a sustained basis. Despite declines in concurrent services use, the homelessness period is overall more costly for episodically and long-term shelter users, primarily owing to the high costs of shelter. High rates of inpatient and foster care services use following the homeless spell suggest that providers of homeless assistance should systematically screen and refer homeless families to on-going community-based service supports. Service use patterns indicate that homeless spells may disrupt continuity of care with community-based health and social services.",
