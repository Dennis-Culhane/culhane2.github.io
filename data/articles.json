    "abstract": "Objectives. Veterans are overrepresented within the homeless population compared with their non-veteran counterparts, particularly when controlling for poverty. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) aims to prevent new episodes of homelessness by targeting households at greatest risk; however, there are no instruments that systematically assess veteransÃ¢ÂÂ risk of homelessness. We developed and tested a brief screening instrument to identify imminent risk of homelessness among veterans accessing VA health care.\r\nMethods. The study team developed initial assessment items, conducted cognitiveinterviews with veterans experiencing homelessness, refined pilot items based on veteransÃ¢ÂÂ and expertsÃ¢ÂÂ feedback and results of psychometric analyses, and assigned weights to items in the final instrument to indicate a measure of homelessness risk.\r\nResults. One-third of veterans who responded to the field instrument reported imminent risk of homelessness (i.e., housing instability in the previous 90 days or expected in the next 90 days). The reliability coefficient for the instrument was 0.85, indicating good internal consistency. Veterans who had a recent change in income, had unpaid housing expenses, were living temporarily withfamily and friends, needed help to get or keep housing, and had poor rental and credit histories were more likely to report a risk of homelessness thanthose who did not.\r\nConclusion. This study provides the field with an instrument to identify individuals and households at risk of or experiencing homelessness, which is necessary to prevent and end homelessness. In addition, it supports VAÃ¢ÂÂs investment in homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing services for veterans who are experiencing or are at risk for homelessness.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we provide one of the most expansive and systematic views to date of the role of employment and earnings in a large, sheltered homeless population consisting of both individual and family households. Using matched and aggregated administrative data from SSA and the New York City (NYC) Department of Homeless Services (DHS), we juxtapose aggregated earnings and shelter-use data for 160,525 sheltered adults during two decades of followup. If employment represents a shock of sufficient magnitude to precipitate homelessness, then these data should show associations between declines in employment and earnings and onset of shelter use. Furthermore, a correspondence between exits from homelessness and increases in employment levels and earnings would further underscore the ties between employment and homelessness.",

    "abstract": "The literature on homelessness among persons with severe mental illness suggests that successful programs for ending homelessness should be both comprehensive in scope and highly responsive to the perspectives of homeless people. Women of Hope is one such program in Philadelphia, which was initiated to serve \"noncompliant,\" treatment-resistant homeless women with mental illness who have a history of living on the streets. Through aggressive outreach and a low-demand congregate housing program, Women of Hope has been successful in bringing 120 women of the streets. Residents are required neither to undergo treatment nor to stay in the program, but are encouraged over time to seek mental health services and medical treatment. Former residents can be found primarily in independent housing and secondarily in highly and moderately structured housing. A diverse range of housing types have been required to place residents, including use of the congregate housing program as a permanent option. Approximately 14% of the former residents have returned to living on the streets, but continue to receive outreach services.",
